    <title>Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) SEARCH</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5323">This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and properties composing Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) SEARCH, an application of the HTTP/1.1 protocol to efficiently search for DAV resources based upon a set of client-supplied criteria.</documentation>
    <http-header def="DASL">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5323#section-9.1.1">The DASL response header indicates server support for query grammars in the OPTIONS method. The value is a list of URIs that indicate the types of supported grammars. Note that although the URIs can be used to identify each supported search grammar, there is not necessarily a direct relationship between the URI and the XML element name that can be used in XML based SEARCH requests (the element name itself is identified by its namespace name (a URI reference) and the element's local name).</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-method def="SEARCH">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5323#section-2">The client invokes the SEARCH method to initiate a server-side search. The body of the request defines the query. The server MUST emit an entity matching the WebDAV multistatus format.</documentation>
