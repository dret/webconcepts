    <title>PATCH Method for HTTP</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789">Several applications extending the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) require a feature to do partial resource modification. The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document. This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing HTTP resource.</documentation>
    <http-header def="Accept-Patch">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-3.1">This specification introduces a new response header Accept-Patch used to specify the patch document formats accepted by the server. Accept-Patch SHOULD appear in the OPTIONS response for any resource that supports the use of the PATCH method. The presence of the Accept-Patch header in response to any method is an implicit indication that PATCH is allowed on the resource identified by the Request-URI.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-method def="PATCH">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789#section-2">The PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-URI. The set of changes is represented in a format called a "patch document" identified by a media type. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, the server MAY create a new resource, depending on the patch document type (whether it can logically modify a null resource) and permissions, etc.</documentation>
