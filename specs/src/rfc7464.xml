    <title>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Text Sequences</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7464">This document describes the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) text sequence format and associated media type "application/json-seq". A JSON text sequence consists of any number of JSON texts, all encoded in UTF-8, each prefixed by an ASCII Record Separator (0x1E), and each ending with an ASCII Line Feed character (0x0A).</documentation>
    <media-type def="application/json-seq">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7464#section-2">"JSON text sequences" are specifically not JSON texts themselves but are composed of (possible) JSON texts. JSON text sequences can be parsed (and produced) incrementally without having to have a streaming parser (nor streaming encoder).</documentation>
