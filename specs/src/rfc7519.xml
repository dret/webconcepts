    <title>JSON Web Token (JWT)</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.</documentation>
    <media-type def="application/jwt">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4">The JWT Claims Set represents a JSON object whose members are the claims conveyed by the JWT.</documentation>
    </media-type>
    <jwt-claim def="iss">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1">The "iss" (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT. The processing of this claim is generally application specific.</documentation>
    </jwt-claim>
    <jwt-claim def="sub">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2">The "sub" (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. The claims in a JWT are normally statements about the subject. The subject value MUST either be scoped to be locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique.</documentation>
    </jwt-claim>
    <jwt-claim def="aud">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3">The "aud" (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST identify itself with a value in the audience claim.</documentation>
    </jwt-claim>
    <jwt-claim def="exp">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4">The "exp" (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of the "exp" claim requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.</documentation>
    </jwt-claim>
    <jwt-claim def="nbf">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.5">The "nbf" (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. The processing of the "nbf" claim requires that the current date/time MUST be after or equal to the not-before date/time listed in the "nbf" claim.</documentation>
    </jwt-claim>
    <jwt-claim def="iat">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6">The "iat" (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. This claim can be used to determine the age of the JWT.</documentation>
    </jwt-claim>
    <jwt-claim def="jti">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7">The "jti" (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT. The identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that there is a negligible probability that the same value will be accidentally assigned to a different data object; if the application uses multiple issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values produced by different issuers as well.</documentation>
    </jwt-claim>
    <oauth-uri def="urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-9">This specification registers the URN "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt" for use by applications that declare content types using URIs (rather than, for instance, media types) to indicate that the content referred to is a JWT.</documentation>
