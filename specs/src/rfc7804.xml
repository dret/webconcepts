    <title>Salted Challenge Response HTTP Authentication Mechanism</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7804">This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which provides a more robust authentication mechanism than a plaintext password protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) and avoids the deployment obstacles presented by earlier TLS-protected challenge response authentication mechanisms.</documentation>
    <http-auth-scheme def="SCRAM-SHA-1">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7804#section-5">HTTP SCRAM is an HTTP Authentication mechanism whose client response and server challenge messages are text-based messages containing one or more attribute-value pairs separated by commas. SCRAM-SHA-1 is registered for database compatibility with implementations of RFC 5802 that want to also expose HTTP access to a related service, but it is not recommended for new deployments.</documentation>
    </http-auth-scheme>
    <http-auth-scheme def="SCRAM-SHA-256">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7804#section-5">HTTP SCRAM is an HTTP Authentication mechanism whose client response and server challenge messages are text-based messages containing one or more attribute-value pairs separated by commas. For interoperability, all HTTP clients and servers supporting SCRAM MUST implement the SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication mechanism.</documentation>
