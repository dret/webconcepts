    <title>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) Extension</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7635">This document proposes the use of OAuth 2.0 to obtain and validate ephemeral tokens that can be used for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) authentication. The usage of ephemeral tokens ensures that access to a STUN server can be controlled even if the tokens are compromised.</documentation>

        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7635#section-4.1.1">The STUN and AS servers could choose to use Representational State Transfer (REST) API over HTTPS to establish a long-term symmetric key. HTTPS MUST be used for data confidentiality, and TLS based on a client certificate MUST be used for mutual authentication. To retrieve a new long-term symmetric key, the STUN server makes an HTTP GET request to the authorization server, specifying STUN as the service to allocate the long-term symmetric keys for and specifying the name of the STUN server.</documentation>
