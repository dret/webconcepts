title:       "Standard Webhooks"
description: "Webhooks are becoming increasingly popular and are used by many of the world's top
companies for sending events to users of their APIs. However, the ecosystem is fragmented,
with each webhook provider using different implementations and varying quality. Even
high quality implementations vary, making them inherently incompatible. This fragmentation
is a pain for the providers and consumers, stifling innovation."
