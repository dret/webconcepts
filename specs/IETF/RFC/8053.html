title:       "HTTP Authentication Extensions for Interactive Clients"
description: "This document specifies extensions for the HTTP authentication framework for interactive
clients. Currently, fundamental features of HTTP-level authentication are insufficient
for complex requirements of various Web-based applications. This forces these applications
to implement their own authentication frameworks by means such as HTML forms, which
becomes one of the hurdles against introducing secure authentication mechanisms handled
jointly by servers and user agents. The extended framework fills gaps between Web
application requirements and HTTP authentication provisions to solve the above problems,
while maintaining compatibility with existing Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentication."
