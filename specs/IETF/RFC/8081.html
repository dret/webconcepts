title:       "The \"font\" Top-Level Media Type"
description: "This memo serves to register and document the \"font\" top-level media type, under
which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered. This document
also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes, which are
representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently registered
under the \"application\" tree by their separate registrations."
