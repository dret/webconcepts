title:       "Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)"
description: "This specification describes how to declare in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the presenter
of the JWT possesses a particular proof-of-possession key and how the recipient can
cryptographically confirm proof of possession of the key by the presenter. Being able
to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as the presenter being a
holder-of-key."
