      <td>This specification describes how to declare in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the presenter
         of the JWT possesses a particular proof-of-possession key and how the recipient can
         cryptographically confirm proof of possession of the key by the presenter. Being able
         to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as the presenter being a
         holder-of-key.
