title:       "A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"
description: "This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for UUIDs (Universally
Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID is 128
bits long, and can guarantee uniqueness across space and time. UUIDs were originally
used in the Apollo Network Computing System and later in the Open Software Foundation's
(OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), and then in Microsoft Windows platforms.
This specification is derived from the DCE specification with the kind permission
of the OSF (now known as The Open Group). Information from earlier versions of the
DCE specification have been incorporated into this document."
