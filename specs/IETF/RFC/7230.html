title:       "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"
description: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed,
collaborative, hypertext information systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide
Web global information initiative since 1990. This document provides an overview of
HTTP architecture and its associated terminology, defines the \"http\" and \"https\"
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes, defines the HTTP/1.1 message syntax and
parsing requirements, and describes general security concerns for implementations."

For messages that do include a payload body, the Content-Length field-value provides the framing information necessary for determining where the body (and message) ends.

<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-header/Upgrade" title="The &amp;#34;Upgrade&amp;#34; header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transitioning from HTTP/1.1 to some other protocol on the same connection. A client MAY send a list of protocols in the Upgrade header field of a request to invite the server to switch to one or more of those protocols, in order of descending preference, before sending the final response.">Upgrade</a>

<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-header/Via" title="The &amp;#34;Via&amp;#34; header field indicates the presence of intermediate protocols and recipients between the user agent and the server (on requests) or between the origin server and the client (on responses), similar to the &amp;#34;Received&amp;#34; header field in email (Section 3.6.7 of RFC 5322). Via can be used for tracking message forwards, avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of senders along the request/response chain.">Via</a>
