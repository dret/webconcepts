title:       "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing"
description: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed,
collaborative, hypertext information systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide
Web global information initiative since 1990. This document provides an overview of
HTTP architecture and its associated terminology, defines the \"http\" and \"https\"
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes, defines the HTTP/1.1 message syntax and
parsing requirements, and describes general security concerns for implementations."
