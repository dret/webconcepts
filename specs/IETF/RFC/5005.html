title:       "Feed Paging and Archiving"
description: "Syndicated Web feeds (using formats such as Atom) are often split into multiple documents
to save bandwidth, allow \"sliding window\" access, or for other purposes. This specification
formalizes two types of feeds that can span one or more feed documents; \"paged\"
feeds and \"archived\" feeds. Additionally, it defines \"complete\" feeds to cover
the case when a single feed document explicitly represents all of the feed's entries."
