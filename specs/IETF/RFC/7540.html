title:       "Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2"
description: "This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources
and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing
multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited
push of representations from servers to clients. This specification is an alternative
to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics
remain unchanged."
