title:       "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Ordered Collections Protocol"
description: "This specification extends the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Protocol
to support the server-side ordering of collection members. Of particular interest
are orderings that are not based on property values, and so cannot be achieved using
a search protocol's ordering option and cannot be maintained automatically by the
server. Protocol elements are defined to let clients specify the position in the ordering
of each collection member, as well as the semantics governing the ordering."

For collections that are ordered, the client SHOULD identify the semantics of the ordering with a URI in the Ordering-Type header, although the client MAY simply set the header value to DAV:custom to indicate that the collection is ordered but the semantics of the ordering are not being advertised.">Ordering-Type</a>

The Position header allows the client to specify that an internal member URI should be first in the collection's ordering, last in the collection's ordering, immediately before some other internal member URI in the collection's ordering, or immediately after some other internal member URI in the collection's ordering.">Position</a>
