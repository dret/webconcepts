title:       "HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento"
description: "The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates
obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime
negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation
that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps
are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given
resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates
a frozen prior state of another resource."
