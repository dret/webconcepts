title:       "Using The ISSN (International Serial Standard Number) as URN (Uniform Resource Names)
within an ISSN-URN Namespace"
description: "This document presents how the ISSN - International Standard Serial Number - which
is a persistent number for unique identification of serials widely recognised and
used in the bibliographic world, can be supported within the Uniform Resource Name
(URN) framework as a specific URN namespace identifier. An ISSN URN resolution system
using the ISSN identifier as Uniform resource Name within an ISN URN Namespace has
been developed by the ISSN International Centre (ISSN-IC) and is operating as a demonstrator
to evaluate all requirements to deploy it in an operational environment. This proceeds
from concepts and proposals developed in several IETF RFCs emphasising the way to
implement and to use \"recognised\" existing numbering system within the URN framework
(RFC 2248, RFC 2141, RFC 2611)."
