title:       "REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol"
description: "This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a peer-to-peer
(P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A P2P signaling protocol provides
its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of cooperating
peers that form the overlay network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation
Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar
requirements by defining new usages that specify the Kinds of data that need to be
stored for a particular application. RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate
enrollment service that provides unique identities. NAT traversal is a fundamental
service of the protocol. RELOAD also allows access from \"client\" nodes that do not
need to route traffic or store data for others."
