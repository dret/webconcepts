title:       "XML Media Types"
description: "This document standardizes five new media types - text/xml, application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity,
application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd - for use in exchanging
network entities that are related to the Extensible Markup Language (XML). This document
also standardizes a convention (using the suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside
of these five types when those media types represent XML MIME (Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions) entities. XML MIME entities are currently exchanged via the HyperText
Transfer Protocol on the World Wide Web, are an integral part of the WebDAV protocol
for remote web authoring, and are expected to have utility in many domains."
