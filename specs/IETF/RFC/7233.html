   <a href="/concepts/http-header/Content-Range" title="The &amp;#34;Content-Range&amp;#34; header field is sent in a single part 206 (Partial Content) response to indicate the partial range of the selected representation enclosed as the message payload, sent in each part of a multipart 206 response to indicate the range enclosed within each body part, and sent in 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) responses to provide information about the selected representation.">Content-Range</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-header/If-Range" title="If a client has a partial copy of a representation and wishes to have an up-to-date copy of the entire representation, it could use the Range header field with a conditional GET (using either or both of If-Unmodified-Since and If-Match.)  However, if the precondition fails because the representation has been modified, the client would then have to make a second request to obtain the entire current representation. The &amp;#34;If-Range&amp;#34; header field allows a client to &amp;#34;short-circuit&amp;#34; the second request. Informally, its meaning is: if the representation is unchanged, send me the part(s) that I am requesting in Range; otherwise, send me the entire representation.">If-Range</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-header/Range" title="The &amp;#34;Range&amp;#34; header field on a GET request modifies the method semantics to request transfer of only one or more subranges of the selected representation data, rather than the entire selected representation data.">Range</a>
