title:       "Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV): Redirect Reference Resources"
description: "This specification defines an extension to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning
(WebDAV) to allow clients to author HTTP redirect reference resources whose default
response is an HTTP/1.1 3xx (Redirection) status code. A redirect reference makes
it possible to access the target resourced indirectly through any URI mapped to the
redirect reference resource. This specification does not address remapping of trees
of resources or regular expression based redirections. There are no integrity guarantees
associated with redirect reference resources. Other mechanisms can also be used to
achieve the same functionality as this specification. This specification allows operators
to experiment with this mechanism and develop experience on what is the best approach
to the problem."
