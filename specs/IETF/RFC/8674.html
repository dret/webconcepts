title:       "The \"safe\" HTTP Preference"
description: "This specification defines a preference for HTTP requests that expresses a desire
to avoid objectionable content, according to the definition of that term by the origin
server. This specification does not define a precise semantic for \"safe\". Rather,
the term is interpreted by the server and within the scope of each web site that chooses
to act upon this information. Support for this preference by clients and servers is
optional."
