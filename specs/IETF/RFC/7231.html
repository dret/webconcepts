<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-method/CONNECT" title="The CONNECT method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to the destination origin server identified by the request-target and, if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding of packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed. Tunnels are commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through one or more proxies, which can then be secured using TLS (Transport Layer Security).">CONNECT</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-method/DELETE" title="The DELETE method requests that the origin server remove the association between the target resource and its current functionality. In effect, this method is similar to the rm command in UNIX: it expresses a deletion operation on the URI mapping of the origin server rather than an expectation that the previously associated information be deleted.">DELETE</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-method/GET" title="The GET method requests transfer of a current selected representation for the target resource. GET is the primary mechanism of information retrieval and the focus of almost all performance optimizations. Hence, when people speak of retrieving some identifiable information via HTTP, they are generally referring to making a GET request.">GET</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-method/HEAD" title="The HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT send a message body in the response (i.e., the response terminates at the end of the header section). The server SHOULD send the same header fields in response to a HEAD request as it would have sent if the request had been a GET, except that the payload header fields MAY be omitted. This method can be used for obtaining metadata about the selected representation without transferring the representation data and is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.">HEAD</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-method/OPTIONS" title="The OPTIONS method requests information about the communication options available for the target resource, at either the origin server or an intervening intermediary. This method allows a client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action.">OPTIONS</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-method/POST" title="The POST method requests that the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request according to the resource's own specific semantics.">POST</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-method/PUT" title="The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be created or replaced with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request message payload. A successful PUT of a given representation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same target resource will result in an equivalent representation being sent in a 200 (OK) response. However, there is no guarantee that such a state change will be observable, since the target resource might be acted upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be subject to dynamic processing by the origin server, before any subsequent GET is received. A successful response only implies that the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its processing by the origin server.">PUT</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-method/TRACE" title="The TRACE method requests a remote, application-level loop-back of the request message. The final recipient of the request SHOULD reflect the message received, excluding some fields described below, back to the client as the message body of a 200 (OK) response with a Content-Type of &amp;#34;message/http&amp;#34;. The final recipient is either the origin server or the first server to receive a Max-Forwards value of zero (0) in the request.">TRACE</a>

The server intends to send a final response after the request has been fully received and acted upon.">100</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/101" title="The 101 (Switching Protocols) status code indicates that the server understands and is willing to comply with the client's request, via the Upgrade header field, for a change in the application protocol being used on this connection. The server MUST generate an Upgrade header field in the response that indicates which protocol(s) will be switched to immediately after the empty line that terminates the 101 response.">101</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/200" title="The 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded. The payload sent in a 200 response depends on the request method.">200</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/201" title="The 201 (Created) status code indicates that the request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.

</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/202" title="The 202 (Accepted) status code indicates that the request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place. There is no facility in HTTP for re-sending a status code from an asynchronous operation.">202</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/203" title="The 203 (Non-Authoritative Information) status code indicates that the request was successful but the enclosed payload has been modified from that of the origin server's 200 (OK) response by a transforming proxy.">203</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/204" title="The 204 (No Content) status code indicates that the server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body. Metadata in the response header fields refer to the target resource and its selected representation after the requested action was applied.">204</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/205" title="The 205 (Reset Content) status code indicates that the server has fulfilled the request and desires that the user agent reset the &amp;#34;document view&amp;#34;, which caused the request to be sent, to its original state as received from the origin server.">205</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/300" title="The 300 (Multiple Choices) status code indicates that the target resource has more than one representation, each with its own more specific identifier, and information about the alternatives is being provided so that the user (or user agent) can select a preferred representation by redirecting its request to one or more of those identifiers. In other words, the server desires that the user agent engage in reactive negotiation to select the most appropriate representation(s) for its needs.">300</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/301" title="The 301 (Moved Permanently) status code indicates that the target resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource ought to use one of the enclosed URIs. Clients with link-editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link references to the effective request URI to one or more of the new references sent by the server, where possible.">301</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/302" title="The 302 (Found) status code indicates that the target resource resides temporarily under a different URI. Since the redirection might be altered on occasion, the client ought to continue to use the effective request URI for future requests.">302</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/303" title="The 303 (See Other) status code indicates that the server is redirecting the user agent to a different resource, as indicated by a URI in the Location header field, which is intended to provide an indirect response to the original request. A user agent can perform a retrieval request targeting that URI (a GET or HEAD request if using HTTP), which might also be redirected, and present the eventual result as an answer to the original request. Note that the new URI in the Location header field is not considered equivalent to the effective request URI.">303</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/305" title="The 305 (Use Proxy) status code was defined in a previous version of HTTP/1.1 and is now deprecated.">305</a>

</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/307" title="The 307 (Temporary Redirect) status code indicates that the target resource resides temporarily under a different URI and the user agent MUST NOT change the request method if it performs an automatic redirection to that URI. Since the redirection can change over time, the client ought to continue using the original effective request URI for future requests.">307</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/400" title="The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).">400</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/402" title="The 402 (Payment Required) status code is reserved for future use.">402</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/403" title="The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. A server that wishes to make public why the request has been forbidden can describe that reason in the response payload (if any).">403</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/404" title="The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists. A 404 status code does not indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or permanent; the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the origin server knows, presumably through some configurable means, that the condition is likely to be permanent.">404</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/405" title="The 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target resource. The origin server MUST generate an Allow header field in a 405 response containing a list of the target resource's currently supported methods.">405</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/406" title="The 406 (Not Acceptable) status code indicates that the target resource does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the user agent, according to the proactive negotiation header fields received in the request, and the server is unwilling to supply a default representation.">406</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/408" title="The 408 (Request Timeout) status code indicates that the server did not receive a complete request message within the time that it was prepared to wait. A server SHOULD send the &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; connection option in the response, since 408 implies that the server has decided to close the connection rather than continue waiting. If the client has an outstanding request in transit, the client MAY repeat that request on a new connection.">408</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/409" title="The 409 (Conflict) status code indicates that the request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource. This code is used in situations where the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. The server SHOULD generate a payload that includes enough information for a user to recognize the source of the conflict.">409</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/410" title="The 410 (Gone) status code indicates that access to the target resource is no longer available at the origin server and that this condition is likely to be permanent. If the origin server does not know, or has no facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the status code 404 (Not Found) ought to be used instead.">410</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/411" title="The 411 (Length Required) status code indicates that the server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length. The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length header field containing the length of the message body in the request message.">411</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/413" title="The 413 (Payload Too Large) status code indicates that the server is refusing to process a request because the request payload is larger than the server is willing or able to process.

<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/414" title="The 414 (URI Too Long) status code indicates that the server is refusing to service the request because the request-target is longer than the server is willing to interpret.">414</a>

<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-status-code/415" title="The 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code indicates that the origin server is refusing to service the request because the payload is in a format not supported by this method on the target resource.
