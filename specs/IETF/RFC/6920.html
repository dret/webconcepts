title:       "Naming Things with Hashes"
description: "This document defines a set of ways to identify a thing (a digital object in this
case) using the output from a hash function. It specifies a new URI scheme for this
purpose, a way to map these to HTTP URLs, and binary and human-speakable formats for
these names. The various formats are designed to support, but not require, a strong
link to the referenced object, such that the referenced object may be authenticated
to the same degree as the reference to it. The reason for this work is to standardise
current uses of hash outputs in URLs and to support new information-centric applications
and other uses of hash outputs in protocols."
