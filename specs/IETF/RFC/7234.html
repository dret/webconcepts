Unless the max-stale request directive is also present, the client is not willing to accept a stale response. The &amp;#34;max-age&amp;#34; response directive indicates that the response is to be considered stale after its age is greater than the specified number of seconds.">max-age</a>

If max-stale is assigned a value, then the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its freshness lifetime by no more than the specified number of seconds. If no value is assigned to max-stale, then the client is willing to accept a stale response of any age.">max-stale</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-cache-directive/min-fresh" title="The &amp;#34;min-fresh&amp;#34; request directive indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is no less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds.

   <a href="/concepts/http-cache-directive/no-cache" title="The &amp;#34;no-cache&amp;#34; request directive indicates that a cache MUST NOT use a stored response to satisfy the request without successful validation on the origin server. The &amp;#34;no-cache&amp;#34; response directive indicates that the response MUST NOT be used to satisfy a subsequent request without successful validation on the origin server. This allows an origin server to prevent a cache from using it to satisfy a request without contacting it, even by caches that have been configured to send stale responses.">no-cache</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-cache-directive/no-store" title="The &amp;#34;no-store&amp;#34; directive indicates that a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this request or any response to it. This directive applies to both private and shared caches. &amp;#34;MUST NOT store&amp;#34; in this context means that the cache MUST NOT intentionally store the information in non-volatile storage, and MUST make a best-effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as possible after forwarding it.">no-store</a>
</code>, 
<code>

   <a href="/concepts/http-cache-directive/only-if-cached" title="The &amp;#34;only-if-cached&amp;#34; request directive indicates that the client only wishes to obtain a stored response. If it receives this directive, a cache SHOULD either respond using a stored response that is consistent with the other constraints of the request, or respond with a 504 (Gateway Timeout) status code. If a group of caches is being operated as a unified system with good internal connectivity, a member cache MAY forward such a request within that group of caches.">only-if-cached</a>

</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-header/Expires" title="The &amp;#34;Expires&amp;#34; header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale. The presence of an Expires field does not imply that the original resource will change or cease to exist at, before, or after that time.">Expires</a>
</code>, 
<code>
   <a href="/concepts/http-header/Pragma" title="The &amp;#34;Pragma&amp;#34; header field allows backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0 caches, so that clients can specify a &amp;#34;no-cache&amp;#34; request that they will understand (as Cache-Control was not defined until HTTP/1.1). When the Cache-Control header field is also present and understood in a request, Pragma is ignored.">Pragma</a>
