title:       "Common Profile for Presence (CPP)"
description: "At the time this document was written, numerous presence protocols were in use (largely
as components of commercial instant messaging services), and little interoperability
between services based on these protocols has been achieved.  This specification defines
common semantics and data formats for presence to facilitate the creation of gateways
between presence services."
