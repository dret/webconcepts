title:       "Group Communication for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)"
description: "The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol
for constrained devices and constrained networks. It is anticipated that constrained
devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building automation scenario,
all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off as a group). This specification
defines how CoAP should be used in a group communication context.  An approach for
using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed based on existing CoAP functionality
as well as new features introduced in this specification.  Also, various use cases
and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate important concepts.  Finally,
guidance is provided for deployment in various network topologies."
