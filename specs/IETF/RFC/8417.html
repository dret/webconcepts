title:       "Security Event Token (SET)"
description: "This specification defines the Security Event Token (SET) data structure. A SET describes
statements of fact from the perspective of an issuer about a subject. These statements
of fact represent an event that occurred directly to or about a security subject,
for example, a statement about the issuance or revocation of a token on behalf of
a subject. This specification is intended to enable representing security- and identity-related
events. A SET is a JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or encrypted.
SETs can be distributed via protocols such as HTTP."
