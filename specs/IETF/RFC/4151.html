description: "This document describes the \"tag\" Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme. Tag
URIs (also known as \"tags\") are designed to be unique across space and time while
being tractable to humans. They are distinct from most other URIs in that they have
no authoritative resolution mechanism. A tag may be used purely as an entity identifier.
Furthermore, using tags has some advantages over the common practice of using \"http\"
URIs as identifiers for non-HTTP-accessible resources."

   <a href="/concepts/uri-scheme/tag" title="A tag is a type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) designed to meet the following requirements: 1. Identifiers are likely to be unique across space and time, and come from a practically inexhaustible supply. 2. Identifiers are relatively convenient for humans to mint (create), read, type, remember etc. 3. No central registration is necessary, at least for holders of domain names or email addresses; and there is negligible cost to mint each new identifier. 4. The identifiers are independent of any particular resolution scheme.">tag</a>
