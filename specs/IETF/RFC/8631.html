title:       "Link Relation Types for Web Services"
description: "Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that are provided
in a context that is managed by one particular service provider. Often, these sets
of resources are referred to as \"Web services\" or \"Web APIs\". This specification
defines link relations that represent relationships from Web services or APIs to resources
that provide documentation, descriptions, metadata, or status information for these
resources. Documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions
are primarily intended for automated consumers. Metadata provides information about
a service's context. This specification also defines a link relation to identify status
resources that are used to represent information about service status."
