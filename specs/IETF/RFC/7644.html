title:       "System for Cross-domain Identity Management: Protocol"
description: "The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is an HTTP-based
protocol that makes managing identities in multi-domain scenarios easier to support
via a standardized service. Examples include, but are not limited to, enterprise-to-cloud
service providers and inter-cloud scenarios.  The specification suite seeks to build
upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on
simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication,
authorization, and privacy models.  SCIM's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity
of user management operations by providing a common user schema, an extension model,
and a service protocol defined by this document."
