title:       "Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1"
description: "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed,
collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol
which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers
and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods,
error codes and headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation,
allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred. HTTP has
been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification
defines the protocol referred to as \"HTTP/1.1\", and is an update to RFC 2068."
