title:       "Instance Digests in HTTP"
description: "HTTP/1.1 defines a Content-MD5 header that allows a server to include a digest of
the response body.  However, this is specifically defined to cover the body of the
actual message, not the contents of the full file (which might be quite different,
if the response is a Content-Range, or uses a delta encoding).  Also, the Content-MD5
is limited to one specific digest algorithm; other algorithms, such as SHA-1 (Secure
Hash Standard), may be more appropriate in some circumstances.  Finally, HTTP/1.1
provides no explicit mechanism by which a client may request a digest.  This document
proposes HTTP extensions that solve these problems."
