title:       "Salted Challenge Response HTTP Authentication Mechanism"
description: "This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication mechanisms called the
Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which provides a more
robust authentication mechanism than a plaintext password protected by Transport Layer
Security (TLS) and avoids the deployment obstacles presented by earlier TLS-protected
challenge response authentication mechanisms."
