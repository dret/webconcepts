title:       "The 'profile' Link Relation Type"
description: "This specification defines the 'profile' link relation type that allows resource representations
to indicate that they are following one or more profiles. A profile is defined not
to alter the semantics of the resource representation itself, but to allow clients
to learn about additional semantics (constraints, conventions, extensions) that are
associated with the resource representation, in addition to those defined by the media
type and possibly other mechanisms."
