title:       "The 'describes' Link Relation Type"
description: "This specification defines the 'describes' link relation type that allows resource
representations to indicate that they are describing another resource. In contexts
where applications want to associate described resources and description resources,
and want to build services based on these associations, the 'describes' link relation
type provides the opposite direction of the 'describedby' link relation type, which
already is a registered link relation type."
