title:       "Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP"
description: "This document defines a new HTTP header that allows web host operators to instruct
user agents to remember (\"pin\") the hosts' cryptographic identities over a period
of time. During that time, user agents (UAs) will require that the host presents a
certificate chain including at least one Subject Public Key Info structure whose fingerprint
matches one of the pinned fingerprints for that host. By effectively reducing the
number of trusted authorities who can authenticate the domain during the lifetime
of the pin, pinning may reduce the incidence of man-in-the-middle attacks due to compromised
Certification Authorities."
