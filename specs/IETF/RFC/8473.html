title:       "Token Binding over HTTP"
description: "This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP servers to cryptographically
bind security tokens (such as cookies and OAuth tokens) to TLS connections. We describe
both first-party and federated scenarios. In a first-party scenario, an HTTP server
is able to cryptographically bind the security tokens that it issues to a client --
and that the client subsequently returns to the server -- to the TLS connection between
the client and the server. Such bound security tokens are protected from misuse, since
the server can generally detect if they are replayed inappropriately, e.g., over other
TLS connections. Federated Token Bindings, on the other hand, allow servers to cryptographically
bind security tokens to a TLS connection that the client has with a different server
than the one issuing the token."
