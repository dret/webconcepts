title:       "The WebSocket Protocol"
description: "The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client running untrusted
code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications
from that code. The security model used for this is the origin-based security model
commonly used by web browsers. The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed
by basic message framing, layered over TCP. The goal of this technology is to provide
a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers
that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest
or &lt;iframe&gt;s and long polling)."
