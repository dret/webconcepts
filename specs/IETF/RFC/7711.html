title:       "PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)"
description: "Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for Transport
Layer Security (TLS) in multi-tenanted environments. As a result, domains hosted in
such environments often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting
service, not the hosted domain. Such deployments force end users and peer services
to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security.
This document defines methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper
server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols. Although these methods
were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as
a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other non-HTTP
application protocols."
