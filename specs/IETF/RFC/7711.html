      <td>Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for Transport
         Layer Security (TLS) in multi-tenanted environments. As a result, domains hosted in
         such environments often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting
         service, not the hosted domain. Such deployments force end users and peer services
         to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security.
         This document defines methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper
         server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols. Although these methods
         were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as
         a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other non-HTTP
         application protocols.
