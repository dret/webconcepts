title:       "Next-Generation Pan-European eCall"
description: "This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support
the next generation of the Pan-European in-vehicle emergency call service defined
under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally referred to as
\"eCall\"). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special form of emergency
calls placed by vehicles, providing real-time communications and an integrated set
of related data. This document also registers MIME media types and an Emergency Call
Data Type for the eCall vehicle data and metadata/control data, and an INFO package
to enable carrying this data in SIP INFO requests. Although this specification is
designed to meet the requirements of next-generation Pan-European eCall (NG-eCall),
it is specified generically such that the technology can be reused or extended to
suit requirements across jurisdictions."
