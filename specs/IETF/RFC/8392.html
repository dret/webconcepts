title:       "CBOR Web Token (CWT)"
description: "CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be transferred between
two parties. The claims in a CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation
(CBOR), and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application-layer
security protection. A claim is a piece of information asserted about a subject and
is represented as a name/value pair consisting of a claim name and a claim value.
CWT is derived from JSON Web Token (JWT) but uses CBOR rather than JSON."
