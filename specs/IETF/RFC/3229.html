title:       "Delta encoding in HTTP"
description: "This document describes how delta encoding can be supported as a compatible extension
to HTTP/1.1. Many HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) requests cause the retrieval
of slightly modified instances of resources for which the client already has a cache
entry. Research has shown that such modifying updates are frequent, and that the modifications
are typically much smaller than the actual entity. In such cases, HTTP would make
more efficient use of network bandwidth if it could transfer a minimal description
of the changes, rather than the entire new instance of the resource. This is called
\"delta encoding.\""
