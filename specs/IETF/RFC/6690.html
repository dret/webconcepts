title:       "Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format"
description: "This specification defines Web Linking using a link format for use by constrained
web servers to describe hosted resources, their attributes, and other relationships
between links. Based on the HTTP Link Header field defined in RFC 5988, the Constrained
RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format is carried as a payload and is assigned an
Internet media type. \"RESTful\" refers to the Representational State Transfer (REST)
architecture. A well-known URI is defined as a default entry point for requesting
the links hosted by a server."
