title:       "Media Types for Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)"
description: "This specification defines media types for representing simple sensor measurements
and device parameters in the Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML). Representations are
defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Concise Binary Object Representation
(CBOR), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), which
share the common SenML data model. A simple sensor, such as a temperature sensor,
could use this media type in protocols such as HTTP or CoAP to transport the measurements
of the sensor or to be configured."
