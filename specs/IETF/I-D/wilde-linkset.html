title:       "Linkset: Media Types and a Link Relation Type for Link Sets"
description: "This specification defines two media types and a link relation type for sets of links.
The media types can be used to represents links in a standalone fashion, in one case
in the native format used in the HTTP Link header, and in the other case in a JSON-based
format. The link relation can be used to reference these kind of standalone link sets,
so that a resource can indicate that additional links putting it into context are
available someplace else. One typical scenario is when the number of links to put
in  an HTTP Link header field becomes too big, and thus these links should be provided
by a distinct resource."
