title:       "HTTP Client Hints"
description: "HTTP defines proactive content negotiation to allow servers to select the appropriate
response for a given request, based upon the user agent's characteristics, as expressed
in request headers. In practice, clients are often unwilling to send those request
headers, because it is not clear whether they will be used, and sending them impacts
both performance and privacy. This document defines an Accept-CH response header that
servers can use to advertise their use of request headers for proactive content negotiation,
along with a set of guidelines for the creation of such headers, colloquially known
as \"Client Hints.\""
