title:       "Expect-CT Extension for HTTP"
description: "This document defines a new HTTP header, named Expect-CT, that allows web host operators
to instruct user agents to expect valid Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be
served on connections to these hosts. When configured in enforcement mode, user agents
(UAs) will remember that hosts expect SCTs and will refuse connections that do not
conform to the UA's Certificate Transparency policy. When configured in report-only
mode, UAs will report the lack of valid SCTs to a URI configured by the host, but
will allow the connection. By turning on Expect-CT, web host operators can discover
misconfigurations in their Certificate Transparency deployments and ensure that misissued
certificates accepted by UAs are discoverable in Certificate Transparency logs."
