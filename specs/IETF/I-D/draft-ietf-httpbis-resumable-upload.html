title:       "Resumable Uploads for HTTP"
description: "HTTP clients often encounter interrupted data transfers as a result of canceled requests
or dropped connections. Prior to interruption, part of a representation may have been
exchanged. To complete the data transfer of the entire representation, it is often
desirable to issue subsequent requests that transfer only the remainder of the representation.
HTTP range requests support this concept of resumable downloads from server to client.
This document describes a mechanism that supports resumable uploads from client to
server using HTTP."
