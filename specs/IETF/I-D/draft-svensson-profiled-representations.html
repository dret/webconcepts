title:       "Indicating, Discovering, Negotiating, and Writing Profiled Representations"
description: "This document details approaches for enriching HTTP interactions with information
pertaining to the profiles to which resource representations conform. It surveys approaches
that were recently introduced to indicate the profile of a resource representation,
and to make representations that conform to a profile discoverable. It introduces
a generally applicable approach to negotiate for a resource representation that conforms
to a profile preferred by a user agent. That approach leverages the existing content
negotiation mechanism but applies it to the profile dimension to which it was previously
not applied. The document also shows how a server can convey which profiled representations
it is able to accept from a user agent."
