**[RFC 2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1](/specs/IETF/RFC/2616 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as &#34;HTTP/1.1&#34;, and is an update to RFC 2068."):** [The default (identity) encoding; the use of no transformation whatsoever. This content-coding is used only in the Accept-Encoding header, and SHOULD NOT be used in the Content-Encoding header.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.6 "Read documentation for HTTP Transfer Coding &#34;identity&#34;")
