HTTP Header Field | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`A-IM`](/concepts/http-header/A-IM "The A-IM request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the instance-manipulations that are acceptable in the response. A response may be the result of applying multiple instance-manipulations. When an A-IM request-header field includes one or more delta-coding values, the request MUST contain an If-None-Match header field, listing one or more entity tags from prior responses for the request-URI.") | [**RFC 3229**: Delta encoding in HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/3229 "This document describes how delta encoding can be supported as a compatible extension to HTTP/1.1. Many HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) requests cause the retrieval of slightly modified instances of resources for which the client already has a cache entry. Research has shown that such modifying updates are frequent, and that the modifications are typically much smaller than the actual entity. In such cases, HTTP would make more efficient use of network bandwidth if it could transfer a minimal description of the changes, rather than the entire new instance of the resource. This is called &#34;delta encoding.&#34;")
[`ALPN`](/concepts/http-header/ALPN "Clients include the ALPN header field in an HTTP CONNECT request to indicate the application-layer protocol that a client intends to use within the tunnel, or a set of protocols that might be used within the tunnel.") | [**RFC 7639**: The ALPN HTTP Header Field](/specs/IETF/RFC/7639 "This specification allows HTTP CONNECT requests to indicate what protocol is intended to be used within the tunnel once established, using the ALPN header field.")
[`Accept`](/concepts/http-header/Accept "The &#34;Accept&#34; header field can be used by user agents to specify response media types that are acceptable. Accept header fields can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.") | [**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](/specs/IETF/RFC/7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content negotiation.")
[`Accept-Additions`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Additions "In HTTP, the &#34;Accept&#34; request-header field is used to specify media types which are acceptable for the response. However, in HTCPCP, the response may result in additional actions on the part of the automated pot. For this reason, HTCPCP adds a new header field, &#34;Accept-Additions&#34;.")<sub title="There are 2 definitions for this value">2</sub> | [**RFC 2324**: Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)](/specs/IETF/RFC/2324 "This document describes HTCPCP, a protocol for controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots.")<br/>[**RFC 7168**: The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol for Tea Efflux Appliances (HTCPCP-TEA)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7168 "The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP) specification does not allow for the brewing of tea, in all its variety and complexity.

In practice, clients are often unwilling to send those request headers, because it is not clear whether they will be used, and sending them impacts both performance and privacy. This document defines an Accept-CH response header that servers can use to advertise their use of request headers for proactive content negotiation, along with a set of guidelines for the creation of such headers, colloquially known as &#34;Client Hints.&#34;")
[`Accept-Charset`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Charset "The &#34;Accept-Charset&#34; header field can be sent by a user agent to indicate what charsets are acceptable in textual response content.

[`Accept-Datetime`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Datetime "The &#34;Accept-Datetime&#34; request header is transmitted by a user agent to indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource. To that end, the &#34;Accept-Datetime&#34; header is conveyed in an HTTP request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its value indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the Original Resource.") | [**RFC 7089**: HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento](/specs/IETF/RFC/7089 "The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource.")
[`Accept-Encoding`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Encoding "Section 5.3.4 of RFC 7231 defines &#34;Accept-Encoding&#34; as a request header field only. This specification expands that definition to allow &#34;Accept-Encoding&#34; as a response header field as well. When present in a response, it indicates what content codings the resource was willing to accept in the associated request. A field value that only contains &#34;identity&#34; implies that no content codings were supported.")<sub title="There are 2 definitions for this value">2</sub> | [**RFC 7694**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Client-Initiated Content-Encoding](/specs/IETF/RFC/7694 "In HTTP, content codings allow for payload encodings such as for compression or integrity checks. In particular, the &#34;gzip&#34; content coding is widely used for payload data sent in response messages. Content codings can be used in request messages as well, however discoverability is not on par with response messages. This document extends the HTTP &#34;Accept-Encoding&#34; header field for use in responses, to indicate that content codings are supported in requests.")<br/>[**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](/specs/IETF/RFC/7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

[`Accept-Features`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Features "The Accept-Features request header can be used by a user agent to give information about the presence or absence of certain features in the feature set of the current request. Servers can use this information when running a remote variant selection algorithm.") | [**RFC 2295**: Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/2295 "HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the same information under a single URL.

Part 5 defines range-specific requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests. This document improves support for responding to range requests for resources of indeterminate size.")
[`Accept-Language`](/concepts/http-header/Accept-Language "The &#34;Accept-Language&#34; header field can be used by user agents to indicate the set of natural languages that are preferred in the response.") | [**RFC 7231**: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](/specs/IETF/RFC/7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.

However, this is specifically defined to cover the body of the actual message, not the contents of the full file (which might be quite different, if the response is a Content-Range, or uses a delta encoding).  Also, the Content-MD5 is limited to one specific digest algorithm; other algorithms, such as SHA-1 (Secure Hash Standard), may be more appropriate in some circumstances.
