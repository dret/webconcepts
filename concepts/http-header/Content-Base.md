[The Content-Base entity-header field may be used to specify the base URI for resolving relative URLs within the entity. This header field is described as Base in RFC 1808, which is expected to be revised.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2068#section-14.11 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Content-Base&#34;") (**[RFC 2068: Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP/1.1](/specs/IETF/RFC/2068 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, object-oriented protocol which can be used for many tasks, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as &#34;HTTP/1.1&#34;.")**)
