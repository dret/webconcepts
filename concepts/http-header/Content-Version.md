description: "The Content-Version entity-header field defines the version tag associated with a rendition of an evolving entity. Together with the Derived-From field, it allows a group of people to work simultaneously on the creation of a work as an iterative process. The field should be used to allow evolution of a particular work along a single path rather than derived works or renditions in different representations."

[The Content-Version entity-header field defines the version tag associated with a rendition of an evolving entity. Together with the Derived-From field, it allows a group of people to work simultaneously on the creation of a work as an iterative process. The field should be used to allow evolution of a particular work along a single path rather than derived works or renditions in different representations.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2068#section-19.6.2.2 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Content-Version&#34;") (**[RFC 2068: Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP/1.1](/specs/IETF/RFC/2068 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, object-oriented protocol which can be used for many tasks, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as &#34;HTTP/1.1&#34;.")**)
