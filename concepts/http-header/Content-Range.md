[The Content-Range entity-header is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-combs-http-indeterminate-range#section-2.2 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Content-Range&#34;") (**[Internet Draft combs-http-indeterminate-range: HTTP/1.1: Range Responses of Indeterminate Length](/specs/IETF/I-D/combs-http-indeterminate-range "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This document updates RFC 7233 Part 5 of the eight-part specification that defines the protocol referred to as &#34;HTTP/1.1&#34;. Part 5 defines range-specific requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests. This document improves support for responding to range requests for resources of indeterminate size.")**)

[The "Content-Range" header field is sent in a single part 206 (Partial Content) response to indicate the partial range of the selected representation enclosed as the message payload, sent in each part of a multipart 206 response to indicate the range enclosed within each body part, and sent in 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) responses to provide information about the selected representation.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7233#section-4.2 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Content-Range&#34;") (**[RFC 7233: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests](/specs/IETF/RFC/7233 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems.
