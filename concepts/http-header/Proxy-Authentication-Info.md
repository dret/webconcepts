title:       "HTTP Header Field: Proxy-Authentication-Info"
description: "The Proxy-Authentication-Info response header field is equivalent to Authentication-Info, except that it applies to proxy authentication. However, unlike Authentication-Info, the Proxy-Authentication-Info header field applies only to the next outbound client on the response chain. This is because only the client that chose a given proxy is likely to have the credentials necessary for authentication."
