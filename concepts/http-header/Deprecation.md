[The "Deprecation" HTTP response header field allows a server to communicate to a client that the URI-identified resource in context of the message is deprecated. It can also provide information that the resource is deprecated since which version.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-deprecation-header#section-2 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Deprecation&#34;") (**[Internet Draft ietf-httpapi-deprecation-header: The Deprecation HTTP Header](/specs/IETF/I-D/ietf-httpapi-deprecation-header "The HTTP Deprecation response header field can be used to signal to consumers of a URI-identified resource that the use of the resource has been deprecated. Additionally, the deprecation link relation can be used to link to a resource that provides additional context for the deprecation, and possibly ways in which clients can find a replacement for the deprecated resource.")**)
