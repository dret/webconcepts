[The GET-Location entity header identifies a substitute resource that can be used in subsequent requests for the same information, but using the GET method.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-reschke-http-get-location#section-3 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;GET-Location&#34;") (**[Internet Draft reschke-http-get-location: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) GET-Location header](/specs/IETF/I-D/reschke-http-get-location "Several hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) extensions use methods other than GET to expose information.  This has the drawback that this kind of information is harder to identify (missing a URL to which a GET request could be applied) and to cache. This document specifies a simple extension header through which a server can advertise a substitute URL that an HTTP client subsequently can use with the GET method.")**)
