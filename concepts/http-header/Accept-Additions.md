[In HTTP, the "Accept" request-header field is used to specify media types which are acceptable for the response. However, in HTCPCP, the response may result in additional actions on the part of the automated pot. For this reason, HTCPCP adds a new header field, "Accept-Additions".](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2324#section-2.2.2.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Accept-Additions&#34;") (**[RFC 2324: Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0)](/specs/IETF/RFC/2324 "This document describes HTCPCP, a protocol for controlling, monitoring, and diagnosing coffee pots.")**)

[It has been observed that some users of blended teas have an occasional preference for teas brewed as an emulsion of cane sugar with hints of water. To allow for this circumstance, the Accept-Additions header field defined in the base HTCPCP specification is updated to allow the following options.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7168#section-2.2.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Accept-Additions&#34;") (**[RFC 7168: The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol for Tea Efflux Appliances (HTCPCP-TEA)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7168 "The Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP) specification does not allow for the brewing of tea, in all its variety and complexity. This paper outlines an extension to HTCPCP to allow for pots to provide networked tea-brewing facilities.")**)
