concept-value: Pragma
description: "The \"Pragma\" header field allows backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0 caches, so that clients can specify a \"no-cache\" request that they will understand (as Cache-Control was not defined until HTTP/1.1). When the Cache-Control header field is also present and understood in a request, Pragma is ignored."
