description: "The \"If-Unmodified-Since\" header field makes the request method conditional on the selected representation's last modification date being earlier than or equal to the date provided in the field-value.

[The "If-Unmodified-Since" header field makes the request method conditional on the selected representation's last modification date being earlier than or equal to the date provided in the field-value. This field accomplishes the same purpose as If-Match for cases where the user agent does not have an entity-tag for the representation.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232#section-3.4 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;If-Unmodified-Since&#34;") (**[RFC 7232: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests](/specs/IETF/RFC/7232 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header fields for indicating state changes, request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when one or more preconditions evaluate to false.")**)
