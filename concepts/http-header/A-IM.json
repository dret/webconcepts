     "description": "The A-IM request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the instance-manipulations that are acceptable in the response. A response may be the result of applying multiple instance-manipulations. When an A-IM request-header field includes one or more delta-coding values, the request MUST contain an If-None-Match header field, listing one or more entity tags from prior responses for the request-URI.",
