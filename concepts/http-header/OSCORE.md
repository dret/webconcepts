[The HTTP OSCORE header field (see Section 13.4) is used for carrying the content of the CoAP OSCORE option when transporting OSCORE messages over HTTP hops.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8613#section-11.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;OSCORE&#34;") (**[RFC 8613: Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)](/specs/IETF/RFC/8613 "This document defines Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), a method for application-layer protection of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), using CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). OSCORE provides end-to-end protection between endpoints communicating using CoAP or CoAP-mappable HTTP. OSCORE is designed for constrained nodes and networks supporting a range of proxy operations, including translation between different transport protocols.")**)
