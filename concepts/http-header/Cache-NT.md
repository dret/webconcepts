[For precisely identifying transferred content independent of the used URL and independent of additional header fields in the context of content negotiation, the Cache-NT header field is used. The new header field carries an SHA-256 value.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-drechsler-httpbis-improved-caching#section-2.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Cache-NT&#34;") (**[Internet Draft drechsler-httpbis-improved-caching: Hypertext Transfer Protocol: Improved HTTP Caching](/specs/IETF/I-D/drechsler-httpbis-improved-caching "This document describes an improved HTTP caching method which can be applied in addition to the standard caching behavior for HTTP. It defines the associated header field that controls this improved caching mechanism and a modified caching operation which is slightly different to standard caching operation for HTTP.")**)
