[The Ext header field is used to indicate that all end-to-end mandatory extension declarations in the request were fulfilled.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2774#section-4.3 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Ext&#34;") (**[RFC 2774: An HTTP Extension Framework](/specs/IETF/RFC/2774 "A wide range of applications have proposed various extensions of the HTTP protocol. Current efforts span an enormous range, including distributed authoring, collaboration, printing, and remote procedure call mechanisms. These HTTP extensions are not coordinated, since there has been no standard framework for defining extensions and thus, separation of concerns. This document describes a generic extension mechanism for HTTP, which is designed to address the tension between private agreement and public specification and to accommodate extension of applications using HTTP clients, servers, and proxies. The proposal associates each extension with a globally unique identifier, and uses HTTP header fields to carry the extension identifier and related information between the parties involved in the extended communication.")**)
