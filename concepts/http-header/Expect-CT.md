[The Expect-CT response header field is a new field defined in this specification. It is used by a server to indicate that UAs should evaluate connections to the host emitting the header field for CT compliance.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9239#section-2.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Expect-CT&#34;") (**[RFC 9163: Expect-CT Extension for HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/9163 "This document defines a new HTTP header field named &#34;Expect-CT&#34;, which allows web host operators to instruct user agents (UAs) to expect valid Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these hosts. Expect-CT allows web host operators to discover misconfigurations in their Certificate Transparency (CT) deployments. Further, web host operators can use Expect-CT to ensure that if a UA that supports Expect-CT accepts a misissued certificate, that certificate will be discoverable in Certificate Transparency logs.")**)
