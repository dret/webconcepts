[The If-Schedule-Tag-Match request header field is used with a method to make it conditional. Clients can set this header to the value returned in the Schedule-Tag response header, or the CALDAV:schedule-tag property, of a scheduling object resource previously retrieved from the server to avoid overwriting "consequential" changes to the scheduling object resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6638#section-8.3 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;If-Schedule-Tag-Match&#34;") (**[RFC 6638: Scheduling Extensions to CalDAV](/specs/IETF/RFC/6638 "This document defines extensions to the Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV) &#34;calendar-access&#34; feature to specify a standard way of performing scheduling operations with iCalendar-based calendar components. This document defines the &#34;calendar-auto-schedule&#34; feature of CalDAV.")**)
