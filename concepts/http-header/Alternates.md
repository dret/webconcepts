description: "The Alternates response header is used to convey the list of variants bound to a negotiable resource. This list can also include directives for any content negotiation process. If a response from a transparently negotiable resource includes an Alternates header, this header MUST contain the complete variant list bound to the negotiable resource. Responses from resources which do not support transparent content negotiation MAY also use Alternates headers."

[The Alternates response header is used to convey the list of variants bound to a negotiable resource. This list can also include directives for any content negotiation process. If a response from a transparently negotiable resource includes an Alternates header, this header MUST contain the complete variant list bound to the negotiable resource. Responses from resources which do not support transparent content negotiation MAY also use Alternates headers.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2295#section-8.3 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Alternates&#34;") (**[RFC 2295: Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP](/specs/IETF/RFC/2295 "HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the same information under a single URL. Transparent content negotiation is an extensible negotiation mechanism, layered on top of HTTP, for automatically selecting the best version when the URL is accessed. This enables the smooth deployment of new web data formats and markup tags.")**)
