     "description": "The Schedule-Reply request header is used by a client to indicate to a server whether or not a scheduling operation ought to occur when an \"Attendee\" deletes a scheduling object resource. In particular, it controls whether a reply scheduling message is sent to the \"Organizer\" as a result of the removal. There are situations in which unsolicited scheduling messages need to be silently removed (or ignored) for security or privacy reasons. This request header allows the scheduling object resource to be removed if such a need arises.",
