{"value":"URI","concept":"http-header","id":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/concepts\/http-header\/URI","details":[{"description":"The URI header field has, in past versions of this specification, been used as a combination of the existing Location, Content-Location, and Vary header fields as well as the future Alternates field. Its primary purpose has been to include a list of additional URIs for the resource, including names and mirror locations. However, it has become clear that the combination of many different functions within this single field has been a barrier to consistently and correctly implementing any of those functions. Furthermore, we believe that the identification of names and mirror locations would be better performed via the Link header field. The URI header field is therefore deprecated in favor of those other fields.","documentation":"http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc2068#section-19.6.2.5","specification":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/specs\/IETF\/RFC\/2068"}]}
