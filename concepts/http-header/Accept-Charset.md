[The "Accept-Charset" header field can be sent by a user agent to indicate what charsets are acceptable in textual response content. This field allows user agents capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-purpose charsets to signal that capability to an origin server that is capable of representing information in those charsets.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.3 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Accept-Charset&#34;") (**[RFC 7231: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](/specs/IETF/RFC/7231 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines the semantics of HTTP/1.1 messages as expressed by request methods, request header fields, response status codes, and response header fields, along with the payload of messages (metadata and body content) and mechanisms for content negotiation.")**)
