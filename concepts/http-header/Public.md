[The Public response-header field lists the set of methods supported by the server. The purpose of this field is strictly to inform the recipient of the capabilities of the server regarding unusual methods. The methods listed may or may not be applicable to the Request-URI; the Allow header field MAY be used to indicate methods allowed for a particular URI.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2068#section-14.35 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Public&#34;") (**[RFC 2068: Hypertext Transfer Protocol - HTTP/1.1](/specs/IETF/RFC/2068 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, object-oriented protocol which can be used for many tasks, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as &#34;HTTP/1.1&#34;.")**)
