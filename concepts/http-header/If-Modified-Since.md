[The "If-Modified-Since" header field makes a GET or HEAD request method conditional on the selected representation's modification date being more recent than the date provided in the field-value. Transfer of the selected representation's data is avoided if that data has not changed.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232#section-3.3 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;If-Modified-Since&#34;") (**[RFC 7232: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests](/specs/IETF/RFC/7232 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines HTTP/1.1 conditional requests, including metadata header fields for indicating state changes, request header fields for making preconditions on such state, and rules for constructing the responses to a conditional request when one or more preconditions evaluate to false.")**)
