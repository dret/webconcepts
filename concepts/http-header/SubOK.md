**[Internet Draft mogul-http-dupsup: Duplicate Suppression in HTTP](/specs/IETF/I-D/mogul-http-dupsup "A significant fraction of Web content is often exactly duplicated under several different URIs. This duplication can lead to suboptimal use of network bandwidth, and unnecessary latency for users. Much of this duplication can be avoided through the use of a simple mechanism, described here, which allows a cache to efficiently substitute one byte-for-byte identical value for another. By doing so, the cache avoids some or all of the network costs associated with retrieving the duplicate value."):** [The SubOK request header field is used to provide directives from an end-client to a proxy cache regarding the possible substitution of an instance body from a cached response for one resource instance for the instance body of the resource instance specified by the client's request.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mogul-http-dupsup#section-5.2.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;SubOK&#34;")
