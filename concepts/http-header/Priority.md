description: "The Priority HTTP header field can appear in requests and responses. A client uses it to specify the priority of the response. A server uses it to inform the client that the priority was overwritten. An intermediary can use the Priority information from client requests and server responses to correct or amend the precedence to suit it. The Priority header field is an end-to-end signal of the request priority from the client or the response priority from the server."

This scheme expresses the priority of each HTTP response using absolute values, rather than as a relative relationship between a group of HTTP responses. This document defines the Priority header field for communicating the initial priority in an HTTP version-independent manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frames for reprioritizing the responses. These share a common format structure that is designed to provide future extensibility.")**)
