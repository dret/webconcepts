[The origin server initiates a session, if it so desires. To do so, it returns an extra response header to the client, Set-Cookie2.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965#section-3.2 "Read documentation for HTTP Header Field &#34;Set-Cookie2&#34;") (**[RFC 2965: HTTP State Management Mechanism](/specs/IETF/RFC/2965 "This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and responses. It describes three new headers, Cookie, Cookie2, and Set-Cookie2, which carry state information between participating origin servers and user agents. The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie proposal [Netscape], but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that use Netscape's method.")**)
