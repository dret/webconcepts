{"value":"If-Range","concept":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/concepts\/http-header\/","id":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/concepts\/http-header\/If-Range","details":[{"description":"If a client has a partial copy of a representation and wishes to have an up-to-date copy of the entire representation, it could use the Range header field with a conditional GET (using either or both of If-Unmodified-Since and If-Match.)  However, if the precondition fails because the representation has been modified, the client would then have to make a second request to obtain the entire current representation. The \"If-Range\" header field allows a client to \"short-circuit\" the second request. Informally, its meaning is: if the representation is unchanged, send me the part(s) that I am requesting in Range; otherwise, send me the entire representation.","documentation":"http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7233#section-3.2","specification":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/specs\/IETF\/RFC\/7233","spec-name":"\"RFC 7233\",\n"}]}
