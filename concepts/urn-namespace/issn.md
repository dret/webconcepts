[In accordance with the ISO standard 3297 International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). The ISSN consists of eight digits in Arabic numerals 0 to 9, except the last digit which is a check digit and can sometimes be an X. The ISSN has no internal meaningful elements to identify language, country, publisher.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3044#section-5 "Read documentation for URN Namespace &#34;issn&#34;") (**[RFC 3044: Using The ISSN (International Serial Standard Number) as URN (Uniform Resource Names) within an ISSN-URN Namespace](/specs/IETF/RFC/3044 "This document presents how the ISSN - International Standard Serial Number - which is a persistent number for unique identification of serials widely recognised and used in the bibliographic world, can be supported within the Uniform Resource Name (URN) framework as a specific URN namespace identifier. An ISSN URN resolution system using the ISSN identifier as Uniform resource Name within an ISN URN Namespace has been developed by the ISSN International Centre (ISSN-IC) and is operating as a demonstrator to evaluate all requirements to deploy it in an operational environment. This proceeds from concepts and proposals developed in several IETF RFCs emphasising the way to implement and to use &#34;recognised&#34; existing numbering system within the URN framework (RFC 2248, RFC 2141, RFC 2611).")**)
