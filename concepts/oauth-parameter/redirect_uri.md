[After completing its interaction with the resource owner, the authorization server directs the resource owner's user-agent back to the client. The authorization server redirects the user-agent to the client's redirection endpoint previously established with the authorization server during the client registration process or when making the authorization request.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2 "Read documentation for OAuth Parameter &#34;redirect_uri&#34;") (**[RFC 6749: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](/specs/IETF/RFC/6749 "The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in RFC 5849.")**)
