description: "The MAC algorithm used to calculate the request MAC. The value MUST be one of \"hmac-sha-1\", \"hmac-sha-256\", or a registered extension algorithm name. The authorization server is assumed to know the set of algorithms supported by the client and the resource server. It selects an algorithm that meets the security policies and is supported by both nodes."

[The MAC algorithm used to calculate the request MAC. The value MUST be one of "hmac-sha-1", "hmac-sha-256", or a registered extension algorithm name. The authorization server is assumed to know the set of algorithms supported by the client and the resource server. It selects an algorithm that meets the security policies and is supported by both nodes.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac#section-4.1 "Read documentation for OAuth Parameter &#34;mac_algorithm&#34;") (**[Internet Draft ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac: OAuth 2.0 Message Authentication Code (MAC) Tokens](/specs/IETF/I-D/ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac "This specification describes how to use MAC Tokens in HTTP requests to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources. An OAuth client willing to access a protected resource needs to demonstrate possession of a cryptographic key by using it with a keyed message digest function to the request. The document also defines a key distribution protocol for obtaining a fresh session key.")**)
