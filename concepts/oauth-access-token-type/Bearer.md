[A security token with the property that any party in possession of the token (a "bearer") can use the token in any way that any other party in possession of it can. Using a bearer token does not require a bearer to prove possession of cryptographic key material (proof-of-possession).](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-1.2 "Read documentation for OAuth Access Token Type &#34;Bearer&#34;") (**[RFC 6750: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage](/specs/IETF/RFC/6750 "This specification describes how to use bearer tokens in HTTP requests to access OAuth 2.0 protected resources. Any party in possession of a bearer token (a &#34;bearer&#34;) can use it to get access to the associated resources (without demonstrating possession of a cryptographic key). To prevent misuse, bearer tokens need to be protected from disclosure in storage and in transport.")**)
