[Although 'acct' URIs take the form "user@host", the scheme is designed for the purpose of identification instead of interaction. The "Internet resource" identified by an 'acct' URI is a user's account hosted at a service provider, where the service provider is typically associated with a DNS domain name.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7565#section-4 "Read documentation for URI Scheme &#34;acct&#34;") (**[RFC 7565: The 'acct' URI Scheme](/specs/IETF/RFC/7565 "This document defines the 'acct' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme as a way to identify a user's account at a service provider, irrespective of the particular protocols that can be used to interact with the account.")**)
