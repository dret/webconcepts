description: "A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is assigned under the \"urn\" URI scheme and a particular URN namespace, with the intent that the URN will be a persistent, location-independent resource identifier. A URN namespace is a collection of such URNs, each of which is unique, assigned in a consistent and managed way, and assigned according to a common definition."

[A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is assigned under the "urn" URI scheme and a particular URN namespace, with the intent that the URN will be a persistent, location-independent resource identifier. A URN namespace is a collection of such URNs, each of which is unique, assigned in a consistent and managed way, and assigned according to a common definition.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141#section-1 "Read documentation for URI Scheme &#34;urn&#34;") (**[RFC 8141: Uniform Resource Names (URNs)](/specs/IETF/RFC/8141 "A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is assigned under the &#34;urn&#34; URI scheme and a particular URN namespace, with the intent that the URN will be a persistent, location-independent resource identifier. With regard to URN syntax, this document defines the canonical syntax for URNs (in a way that is consistent with URI syntax), specifies methods for determining URN-equivalence, and discusses URI conformance. With regard to URN namespaces, this document specifies a method for defining a URN namespace and associating it with a namespace identifier, and it describes procedures for registering namespace identifiers with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This document obsoletes both RFCs 2141 and 3406.")**)
