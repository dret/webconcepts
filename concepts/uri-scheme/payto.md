description: "A 'payto' URI always identifies the target of a payment. A 'payto' URI consists of a payment target type, a target identifier, and optional parameters such as an amount or a payment reference. The interpretation of the target identifier is defined by the payment target type and typically represents either a bank account or an (unsettled) transaction. A unified URI scheme for all payment target types allows applications to offer user interactions with URIs that represent payment targets, simplifying the introduction of new payment systems and applications."
