[The "mid" (Message-ID) and "cid" (Content-ID) URL schemes provide identifiers for messages and their body parts. The "cid" scheme refers to a specific body part of a message; its use is generally limited to references to other body parts in the same message as the referring body part.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2392#section-2 "Read documentation for URI Scheme &#34;cid&#34;") (**[RFC 2392: Content-ID and Message-ID Uniform Resource Locators](/specs/IETF/RFC/2392 "The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) schemes, &#34;cid:&#34; and &#34;mid:&#34; allow references to messages and the body parts of messages. For example, within a single multipart message, one HTML body part might include embedded references to other parts of the same message.")**)
