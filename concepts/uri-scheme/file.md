[A file URI identifies an object (a "file") stored in a structured object naming and accessing environment on a host (a "file system"). The URI can be used in discussions about the file, and if other conditions are met it can be dereferenced to directly access the file.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8089#section-1 "Read documentation for URI Scheme &#34;file&#34;") (**[RFC 8089: The "file" URI Scheme](/specs/IETF/RFC/8089 "This document provides a more complete specification of the &#34;file&#34; Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme and replaces the very brief definition in Section 3.10 of RFC 1738. It defines a common syntax that is intended to interoperate across the broad spectrum of existing usages. At the same time, it notes some other current practices around the use of file URIs.")**)
