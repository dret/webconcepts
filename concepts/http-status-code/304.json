In other words, there is no need for the server to transfer a representation of the target resource because the request indicates that the client, which made the request conditional, already has a valid representation; the server is therefore redirecting the client to make use of that stored representation as if it were the payload of a 200 (OK) response.","documentation":"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-4.1","specification":"http://webconcepts.info/specs/IETF/RFC/7232"}]}
