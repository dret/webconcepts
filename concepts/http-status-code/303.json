A user agent can perform a retrieval request targeting that URI (a GET or HEAD request if using HTTP), which might also be redirected, and present the eventual result as an answer to the original request. Note that the new URI in the Location header field is not considered equivalent to the effective request URI.","documentation":"http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7231#section-6.4.4","specification":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/specs\/IETF\/RFC\/7231","spec-name":"RFC 7231"}]}
