This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.","documentation":"http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc2518#section-10.1","specification":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/specs\/IETF\/RFC\/2518"}]}
