[The 508 (Loop Detected) status code indicates that the server terminated an operation because it encountered an infinite loop while processing a request with "Depth: infinity". This status indicates that the entire operation failed.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842#section-7.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Status Code &#34;508&#34;") (**[RFC 5842: Binding Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)](/specs/IETF/RFC/5842 "This specification defines bindings, and the BIND method for creating multiple bindings to the same resource. Creating a new binding to a resource causes at least one new URI to be mapped to that resource. Servers are required to ensure the integrity of any bindings that they allow to be created.")**)
