[The SETTINGS frame (type=0x4) conveys configuration parameters that affect how endpoints communicate, such as preferences and constraints on peer behavior. The SETTINGS frame is also used to acknowledge the receipt of those parameters.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-6.5 "Read documentation for HTTP/2 Frame Type &#34;0x4&#34;") (**[RFC 7540: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2](/specs/IETF/RFC/7540 "This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients. This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.")**)
