[The WINDOW_UPDATE frame (type=0x8) is used to implement flow control. Flow control operates at two levels: on each individual stream and on the entire connection.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-6.9 "Read documentation for HTTP/2 Frame Type &#34;0x8&#34;") (**[RFC 7540: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2](/specs/IETF/RFC/7540 "This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients. This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.")**)
