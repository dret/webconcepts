[The "service-meta" link relation type is used to link to available metadata for the service context of a resource. It identifies general metadata for the context that is primarily intended for consumption by machines. In many cases, it is provided in a representation that is consumed by tools, code libraries, or similar components.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8631#section-4.3 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;service-meta&#34;") (**[RFC 8631: Link Relation Types for Web Services](/specs/IETF/RFC/8631 "Many resources provided on the Web are part of sets of resources that are provided in a context that is managed by one particular service provider. Often, these sets of resources are referred to as &#34;Web services&#34; or &#34;Web APIs&#34;. This specification defines link relations that represent relationships from Web services or APIs to resources that provide documentation, descriptions, metadata, or status information for these resources. Documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers. Metadata provides information about a service's context. This specification also defines a link relation to identify status resources that are used to represent information about service status.")**)
