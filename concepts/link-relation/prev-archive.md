[A URI that refers to the immediately preceding archive document.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005#section-4 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;prev-archive&#34;") (**[RFC 5005: Feed Paging and Archiving](/specs/IETF/RFC/5005 "Syndicated Web feeds (using formats such as Atom) are often split into multiple documents to save bandwidth, allow &#34;sliding window&#34; access, or for other purposes. This specification formalizes two types of feeds that can span one or more feed documents; &#34;paged&#34; feeds and &#34;archived&#34; feeds. Additionally, it defines &#34;complete&#34; feeds to cover the case when a single feed document explicitly represents all of the feed's entries.")**)
