[The "linkset" link relation type is used by a resource to link to a resource that provides a set of links. Typically the Context IRI of these links  is the URI of the responding resource but links with other Context IRIs MAY be provided.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-linkset#section-5 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;linkset&#34;") (**[Internet Draft ietf-httpapi-linkset: Linkset: Media Types and a Link Relation Type for Link Sets](/specs/IETF/I-D/ietf-httpapi-linkset "This specification defines two document formats and respective media types for representing sets of links as stand-alone resources. One format is JSON-based, the other aligned with the format for representing links in the HTTP &#34;Link&#34; header field. This specification also introduces a link relation type to support discovery of sets of links.")**)
