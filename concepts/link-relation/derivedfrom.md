[The document linked to was later converted to the document that contains this link relation. For example, an RFC can have a link to the Internet Draft that became the RFC; in that case, the link relation would be "derivedfrom".](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-hoffman-xml2rfc#section-6.2 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;derivedfrom&#34;") (**[Internet Draft hoffman-xml2rfc: The 'XML2RFC' version 3 Vocabulary](/specs/IETF/I-D/hoffman-xml2rfc "This document defines the &#34;XML2RFC&#34; version 3 vocabulary; an XML-based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts. It is heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under discussion. This document obsoletes the v2 grammar described in RFC 2629 and its expected followup, draft-reschke-xml2rfc.")**)
