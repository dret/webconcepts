[The 'invalidates' link relation type allows a response that signifies a state change on the server to indicate one or more associated URIs whose states have also changed.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-linked-cache-inv#section-2 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;invalidates&#34;") (**[Internet Draft nottingham-linked-cache-inv: Linked Cache Invalidation](/specs/IETF/I-D/nottingham-linked-cache-inv "This memo defines two new link types that indicate relationships between resources in terms of cache invalidation, along with a HTTP cache-control extension that takes advantage of those relationships to use them to extend response freshness. Collectively, this is referred to as Linked Cache Invalidation (LCI).")**)
