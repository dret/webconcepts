[A URI that refers to the immediately following document in a series of documents.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005#section-3 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;next&#34;") (**[RFC 5005: Feed Paging and Archiving](/specs/IETF/RFC/5005 "Syndicated Web feeds (using formats such as Atom) are often split into multiple documents to save bandwidth, allow &#34;sliding window&#34; access, or for other purposes. This specification formalizes two types of feeds that can span one or more feed documents; &#34;paged&#34; feeds and &#34;archived&#34; feeds. Additionally, it defines &#34;complete&#34; feeds to cover the case when a single feed document explicitly represents all of the feed's entries.")**)

[Refers to the next document in a linear sequence of documents. User agents may choose to preload the "next" document, to reduce the perceived load time.](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/links.html#link-type-next "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;next&#34;") (**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/html: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)](/specs/W3C/TR/html "This specification defines the 5th major version, second minor revision of the core language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version, new features continue to be introduced to help Web application authors, new elements continue to be introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention continues to be given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability.")**)
