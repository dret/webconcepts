[The 'inv-by' link relation type allows a response to nominate one or more other resources that affect the state of the resource it's associated with. That is, when one of the nominated resources changes, it also changes the state of this response's resource.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-linked-cache-inv#section-3 "Read documentation for Link Relation &#34;inv-by&#34;") (**[Internet Draft nottingham-linked-cache-inv: Linked Cache Invalidation](/specs/IETF/I-D/nottingham-linked-cache-inv "This memo defines two new link types that indicate relationships between resources in terms of cache invalidation, along with a HTTP cache-control extension that takes advantage of those relationships to use them to extend response freshness. Collectively, this is referred to as Linked Cache Invalidation (LCI).")**)
