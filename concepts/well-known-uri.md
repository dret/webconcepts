The server MUST redirect HTTP requests for that resource to the actual &#34;context path&#34; using one of the available mechanisms provided by HTTP (e.g., using a 301, 303, or 307 response). Clients MUST handle HTTP redirects on the &#34;.well-known&#34; URI.

[`change-password`](/concepts/well-known-uri/change-password "A change password url of an origin is a URL that points to a resource that clients can use to discover where a user should go to update their password on origin.") | [**W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/webappsec-change-password-url**: A Well-Known URL for Changing Passwords](/specs/W3C/TR/webappsec-change-password-url "This specification defines a well-known URL that sites can use to make their change password forms discoverable by tools. This simple affordance provides a way for software to help the user find the way to change their password.")
[`coap`](/concepts/well-known-uri/coap "For &#34;coap+ws&#34; respectively &#34;coaps+ws&#34; URIs, the WebSocket endpoint is identified by a &#34;ws&#34; respectively &#34;wss&#34; URI that is composed of the authority part of the URI and the well-known path &#34;/.well-known/coap&#34;.") | [**RFC 8283**: CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets](/specs/IETF/RFC/8283 "The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), although inspired by HTTP, was designed to use UDP instead of TCP. The message layer of CoAP over UDP includes support for reliable delivery, simple congestion control, and flow control. Some environments benefit from the availability of CoAP carried over reliable transports such as TCP or Transport Layer Security (TLS). This document outlines the changes required to use CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets transports. It also formally updates RFC 7641 for use with these transports and RFC 7959 to enable the use of larger messages over a reliable transport.")
[`core`](/concepts/well-known-uri/core "Resource discovery in CoRE is accomplished through the use of a well-known resource URI that returns a list of links about resources hosted by that server and other link relations. Well-known resources have a path component that begins with &#34;/.well-known/&#34; as specified in RFC 5785. This specification defines a new well-known resource for CoRE Resource Discovery: &#34;/.well-known/core&#34;.") | [**RFC 6690**: Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format](/specs/IETF/RFC/6690 "This specification defines Web Linking using a link format for use by constrained web servers to describe hosted resources, their attributes, and other relationships between links. Based on the HTTP Link Header field defined in RFC 5988, the Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format is carried as a payload and is assigned an Internet media type. &#34;RESTful&#34; refers to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. A well-known URI is defined as a default entry point for requesting the links hosted by a server.")
[`csvm`](/concepts/well-known-uri/csvm "If the user has not supplied a metadata file as overriding metadata and no applicable metadata file has been discovered through a Link header, processors must attempt to locate a metadata documents through site-wide configuration. In this case, processors must retrieve the file from the well-known URI /.well-known/csvm.") | [**W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-model**: Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web](/specs/W3C/TR/tabular-data-model "Tabular data is routinely transferred on the web in a variety of formats, including variants on CSV, tab-delimited files, fixed field formats, spreadsheets, HTML tables, and SQL dumps. This document outlines a data model, or infoset, for tabular data and metadata about that tabular data that can be used as a basis for validation, display, or creating other formats. It also contains some non-normative guidance for publishing tabular data as CSV and how that maps into the tabular data model. An annotated model of tabular data can be supplemented by separate metadata about the table. This specification defines how implementations should locate that metadata, given a file containing tabular data. The standard syntax for that metadata is defined in tabular metadata. Note, however, that applications may have other means to create annotated tables, e.g., through some application specific APIs; this model does not depend on the specificities described in tabular-metadata.")
[`dnt`](/concepts/well-known-uri/dnt "A site-wide tracking status resource provides information about the potential tracking behavior of resources located at that origin server. A site-wide tracking status resource has the well-known identifier /.well-known/dnt/ relative to the origin server's URI.") | [**W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt**: Tracking Preference Expression (DNT)](/specs/W3C/TR/tracking-dnt "This specification defines the technical mechanisms for expressing a tracking preference via the DNT request header field in HTTP, via an HTML DOM property readable by embedded scripts, and via properties accessible to various user agent plug-in or extension APIs. It also defines mechanisms for sites to signal whether and how they honor this preference, both in the form of a machine-readable tracking status resource at a well-known location and via a &#34;Tk&#34; response header field, and a mechanism for allowing the user to approve exceptions to DNT as desired.")
[`est`](/concepts/well-known-uri/est "The EST server MUST support the use of the path-prefix of &#34;/.well-known/&#34; and the registered name of &#34;est&#34;. Thus, a valid EST server URI path begins with &#34;https://www.example.com/.well-known/est&#34;. Each EST operation is indicated by a path-suffix that indicates the intended operation.") | [**RFC 7030**: Enrollment over Secure Transport](/specs/IETF/RFC/7030 "This document profiles certificate enrollment for clients using Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) messages over a secure transport. This profile, called Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST), describes a simple, yet functional, certificate management protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) clients that need to acquire client certificates and associated Certification Authority (CA) certificates. It also supports client-generated public/private key pairs as well as key pairs generated by the CA.")
[`genid`](/concepts/well-known-uri/genid "Systems that want Skolem IRIs to be recognizable outside of the system boundaries should use a well-known IRI with the registered name genid. This is an IRI that uses the HTTP or HTTPS scheme, or another scheme that has been specified to use well-known IRIs; and whose path component starts with /.well-known/genid/.") | [**W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts**: RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax](/specs/W3C/TR/rdf11-concepts "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for representing information in the Web. This document defines an abstract syntax (a data model) which serves to link all RDF-based languages and specifications. The abstract syntax has two key data structures: RDF graphs are sets of subject-predicate-object triples, where the elements may be IRIs, blank nodes, or datatyped literals. They are used to express descriptions of resources. RDF datasets are used to organize collections of RDF graphs, and comprise a default graph and zero or more named graphs. RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax also introduces key concepts and terminology, and discusses datatyping and the handling of fragment identifiers in IRIs within RDF graphs.")
[`hoba`](/concepts/well-known-uri/hoba "HOBA-http uses a well-known URI &#34;hoba&#34; as a base URI for performing many tasks: &#34;https://www.example.com/.well-known/hoba&#34;. These URIs are based on the name of the host that the HTTP client is accessing.") | [**RFC 7486**: HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7486 "HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a digital-signature-based design for an HTTP authentication method. The design can also be used in JavaScript-based authentication embedded in HTML. HOBA is an alternative to HTTP authentication schemes that require passwords and therefore avoids all problems related to passwords, such as leakage of server-side password databases.")
[`host-meta`](/concepts/well-known-uri/host-meta "The client obtains the host-meta document for a given host by sending an HTTP or an HTTPS GET request to the host for the &#34;/.well-known/host-meta&#34; path.") | [**RFC 6415**: Web Host Metadata](/specs/IETF/RFC/6415 "This specification describes a method for locating host metadata as well as information about individual resources controlled by the host.")
[`host-meta.json`](/concepts/well-known-uri/host-meta.json "Alternatively, the client MAY request a JRD representation by requesting the &#34;host-meta.json&#34; well-known document, by making a GET request for &#34;/.well-known/host-meta.json&#34;, following the same process used for &#34;/.well-known/host-meta&#34;.") | [**RFC 6415**: Web Host Metadata](/specs/IETF/RFC/6415 "This specification describes a method for locating host metadata as well as information about individual resources controlled by the host.")
[`http-opportunistic`](/concepts/well-known-uri/http-opportunistic "This specification requires that a server send both an alternative service advertisement and host content in a well-known location to send HTTP requests over TLS.") | [**RFC 8164**: Opportunistic Security for HTTP/2](/specs/IETF/RFC/8164 "This document describes how &#34;http&#34; URIs can be accessed using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and HTTP/2 to mitigate pervasive monitoring attacks. This mechanism not a replacement for &#34;https&#34; URIs; it is vulnerable to active attacks.")
[`ni`](/concepts/well-known-uri/ni "We define a mapping between URIs following the ni URI scheme and HTTP or HTTPS URLs that makes use of the .well-known URI by defining an &#34;ni&#34; suffix.") | [**RFC 6920**: Naming Things with Hashes](/specs/IETF/RFC/6920 "This document defines a set of ways to identify a thing (a digital object in this case) using the output from a hash function. It specifies a new URI scheme for this purpose, a way to map these to HTTP URLs, and binary and human-speakable formats for these names. The various formats are designed to support, but not require, a strong link to the referenced object, such that the referenced object may be authenticated to the same degree as the reference to it. The reason for this work is to standardise current uses of hash outputs in URLs and to support new information-centric applications and other uses of hash outputs in protocols.")
[`openpgpkey`](/concepts/well-known-uri/openpgpkey "Used for the discovery of Web keys that are made available using the OpenPGP Web Key Service.") | [**Internet Draft koch-openpgp-webkey-service**: OpenPGP Web Key Service](/specs/IETF/I-D/koch-openpgp-webkey-service "This specification describes a service to locate OpenPGP keys by mail address using a Web service and the HTTPS protocol.  It also provides a method for secure communication between the key owner and the mail provider to publish and revoke the public key.")
[`posh`](/concepts/well-known-uri/posh "The suffix &#34;posh&#34; is expected to be followed by an additional path component consisting of a service name (say, &#34;spice&#34;) and a file extension of &#34;.json&#34;, resulting in a full path of, for instance, &#34;/.well-known/posh/spice.json&#34;. Registration of service names shall be requested by developers of the relevant application protocols.") | [**RFC 7711**: PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7711 "Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in multi-tenanted environments. As a result, domains hosted in such environments often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain. Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security. This document defines methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols. Although these methods were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other non-HTTP application protocols.")
[`reload-config`](/concepts/well-known-uri/reload-config "If a URL for the configuration server is not provided, the node MUST do a DNS SRV query using a Service name of &#34;reload-config&#34; and a protocol of TCP to find a configuration server and form the URL by appending a path of &#34;/.well-known/reload-config&#34; to the overlay name.") | [**RFC 6940**: REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Base Protocol](/specs/IETF/RFC/6940 "This specification defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a peer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the Kinds of data that need to be stored for a particular application. RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique identities. NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol. RELOAD also allows access from &#34;client&#34; nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data for others.")
[`repute-template`](/concepts/well-known-uri/repute-template "A reputation query made via HTTP encodes the question being asked in an HTTP GET method.  The specific syntax of the query itself is specified by retrieving a URI template from the reputation service, completing the template, and then issuing the query. The template file is retrieved by requesting the well-known URI &#34;repute-template&#34; from the host providing reputation service, using HTTP.") | [**RFC 7072**: A Reputation Query Protocol](/specs/IETF/RFC/7072 "This document defines a mechanism to conduct queries for reputation information over the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as the payload meta-format.")
[`stun-key`](/concepts/well-known-uri/stun-key "The STUN and AS servers could choose to use Representational State Transfer (REST) API over HTTPS to establish a long-term symmetric key. HTTPS MUST be used for data confidentiality, and TLS based on a client certificate MUST be used for mutual authentication. To retrieve a new long-term symmetric key, the STUN server makes an HTTP GET request to the authorization server, specifying STUN as the service to allocate the long-term symmetric keys for and specifying the name of the STUN server.") | [**RFC 7635**: Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) Extension](/specs/IETF/RFC/7635 "This document proposes the use of OAuth 2.0 to obtain and validate ephemeral tokens that can be used for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) authentication. The usage of ephemeral tokens ensures that access to a STUN server can be controlled even if the tokens are compromised.")
[`timezone`](/concepts/well-known-uri/timezone "A &#34;well-known&#34; URI is registered by this specification for the Time Zone Data Distribution service, &#34;timezone&#34;. This URI points to a resource that the client can use as the initial &#34;context path&#34; for the service they are trying to connect to. The server MUST redirect HTTP requests for that resource to the actual &#34;context path&#34; using one of the available mechanisms provided by HTTP.") | [**RFC 7808**: Time Zone Data Distribution Service](/specs/IETF/RFC/7808 "This document defines a time zone data distribution service that allows reliable, secure, and fast delivery of time zone data and leap-second rules to client systems such as calendaring and scheduling applications or operating systems.")
[`void`](/concepts/well-known-uri/void "The URI /.well-known/void on any Web server is registered by this specification for a VoID description of any datasets hosted on that server. This URI may be an HTTP redirect to the location of the actual VoID file.") | [**W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/void**: Describing Linked Datasets with the VoID Vocabulary](/specs/W3C/TR/void "VoID is an RDF Schema vocabulary for expressing metadata about RDF datasets. It is intended as a bridge between the publishers and users of RDF data, with applications ranging from data discovery to cataloging and archiving of datasets. This document is a detailed guide to the VoID vocabulary. It describes how VoID can be used to express general metadata based on Dublin Core, access metadata, structural metadata, and links between datasets. It also provides deployment advice and discusses the discovery of VoID descriptions.")
[`webfinger`](/concepts/well-known-uri/webfinger "A WebFinger request is an HTTPS request to a WebFinger resource. A WebFinger resource is a well-known URI [3] using the HTTPS scheme constructed along with the required query target and optional link relation types. The path component of a WebFinger URI MUST be the well-known path &#34;/.well-known/webfinger&#34;. A WebFinger URI MUST contain a query component that encodes the query target and optional link relation types.") | [**RFC 7033**: WebFinger](/specs/IETF/RFC/7033 "This specification defines the WebFinger protocol, which can be used to discover information about people or other entities on the Internet using standard HTTP methods. WebFinger discovers information for a URI that might not be usable as a locator otherwise, such as account or email URIs.")
