[The "s-maxage" response directive indicates that, in shared caches, the maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header field. The s-maxage directive also implies the semantics of the proxy-revalidate response directive.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7234#section-5.2.2.9 "Read documentation for HTTP Cache Directive &#34;s-maxage&#34;") (**[RFC 7234: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching](/specs/IETF/RFC/7234 "The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information systems. This document defines requirements on HTTP caches and the associated header fields that control cache behavior or indicate cacheable response messages.")**)
