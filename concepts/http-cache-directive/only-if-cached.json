If it receives this directive, a cache SHOULD either respond using a stored response that is consistent with the other constraints of the request, or respond with a 504 (Gateway Timeout) status code. If a group of caches is being operated as a unified system with good internal connectivity, a member cache MAY forward such a request within that group of caches.","documentation":"http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7234#section-5.2.1.7","specification":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/specs\/IETF\/RFC\/7234"}]}
