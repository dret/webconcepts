[When present in an HTTP response, the immutable Cache-Control extension indicates that the origin server MUST NOT update the representation of that resource during the freshness lifetime of the response.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8246#section-2 "Read documentation for HTTP Cache Directive &#34;immutable&#34;") (**[RFC 8246: HTTP Immutable Responses](/specs/IETF/RFC/8246 "The immutable HTTP response Cache-Control extension allows servers to identify resources that will not be updated during their freshness lifetime. This ensures that a client never needs to revalidate a cached fresh resource to be certain it has not been modified.")**)
