[When present, the 'inv-maxage' cache-control extension indicates the number of seconds that caches who implement Linked Cache invalidation can consider responses fresh for, provided they are not invalidated.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-linked-cache-inv#section-4 "Read documentation for HTTP Cache Directive &#34;inv-maxage&#34;") (**[Internet Draft nottingham-linked-cache-inv: Linked Cache Invalidation](/specs/IETF/I-D/nottingham-linked-cache-inv "This memo defines two new link types that indicate relationships between resources in terms of cache invalidation, along with a HTTP cache-control extension that takes advantage of those relationships to use them to extend response freshness. Collectively, this is referred to as Linked Cache Invalidation (LCI).")**)
