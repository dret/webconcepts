URI Scheme | Specification
-------: | :-------
[`about`](/concepts/uri-scheme/about "The resource that is referenced by a particular &#34;about&#34; URI is denoted by the &lt;about-token> part of the URI.") | [**RFC 6694**: The "about" URI Scheme](/specs/IETF/RFC/6694 "This document describes the &#34;about&#34; URI scheme, which is widely used by Web browsers and some other applications to designate access to their internal resources, such as settings, application information, hidden built-in functionality, and so on.")
[`acct`](/concepts/uri-scheme/acct "Although 'acct' URIs take the form &#34;user@host&#34;, the scheme is designed for the purpose of identification instead of interaction. The &#34;Internet resource&#34; identified by an 'acct' URI is a user's account hosted at a service provider, where the service provider is typically associated with a DNS domain name.") | [**RFC 7565**: The 'acct' URI Scheme](/specs/IETF/RFC/7565 "This document defines the 'acct' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme as a way to identify a user's account at a service provider, irrespective of the particular protocols that can be used to interact with the account.")
[`arcp`](/concepts/uri-scheme/arcp "The &#34;arcp&#34; URI scheme follows the RFC 3986 syntax for hierarchical URIs. The &#34;arcp-authority&#34; component provides a unique identifier for the opened archive. The &#34;path-absolute&#34; component provides the absolute path of a resource (e.g. a file or directory) within the archive.") | [**Internet Draft soilandreyes-arcp**: The Archive and Packaging (arcp) URI scheme](/specs/IETF/I-D/soilandreyes-arcp "This specification proposes the Application and Packaging Pointer URI scheme &#34;arcp&#34;. arcp URIs can be used to consume or reference hypermedia resources bundled inside a file archive or an application package, as well as to resolve URIs for archive resources within a programmatic framework. This URI scheme provides mechanisms to generate a unique base URI to represent the root of the archive, so that relative URI references in a bundled resource can be resolved within the archive without having to extract the archive content on the local file system. An arcp URI can be used for purposes of isolation (e.g. when consuming multiple archives), security constraints (avoiding &#34;climb out&#34; from the archive), or for externally identifying sub-resources referenced by hypermedia formats.")
[`cap`](/concepts/uri-scheme/cap "The CAP URL scheme is used to designate both calendar stores and calendars accessible using the CAP protocol.") | [**RFC 4324**: Calendar Access Protocol (CAP)](/specs/IETF/RFC/4324 "The Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) described in this memo permits a Calendar User (CU) to utilize a Calendar User Agent (CUA) to access an iCAL-based Calendar Store (CS). At the time of this writing, three vendors are implementing CAP, but it has already been determined that some changes are needed. In order to get implementation experience, the participants felt that a CAP specification is needed to preserve many years of work. Many properties in CAP which have had many years of debate, can be used by other iCalendar protocols.")
[`cid`](/concepts/uri-scheme/cid "The &#34;mid&#34; (Message-ID) and &#34;cid&#34; (Content-ID) URL schemes provide identifiers for messages and their body parts. The &#34;cid&#34; scheme refers to a specific body part of a message; its use is generally limited to references to other body parts in the same message as the referring body part.") | [**RFC 2392**: Content-ID and Message-ID Uniform Resource Locators](/specs/IETF/RFC/2392 "The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) schemes, &#34;cid:&#34; and &#34;mid:&#34; allow references to messages and the body parts of messages. For example, within a single multipart message, one HTML body part might include embedded references to other parts of the same message.")
[`coap+tcp`](/concepts/uri-scheme/coap+tcp "The &#34;coap+tcp&#34; URI scheme identifies CoAP resources that are intended to be accessible using CoAP over TCP.") | [**RFC 8283**: CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets](/specs/IETF/RFC/8283 "The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), although inspired by HTTP, was designed to use UDP instead of TCP. The message layer of CoAP over UDP includes support for reliable delivery, simple congestion control, and flow control. Some environments benefit from the availability of CoAP carried over reliable transports such as TCP or Transport Layer Security (TLS). This document outlines the changes required to use CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets transports. It also formally updates RFC 7641 for use with these transports and RFC 7959 to enable the use of larger messages over a reliable transport.")
[`coap+ws`](/concepts/uri-scheme/coap+ws "The &#34;coap+ws&#34; URI scheme identifies CoAP resources that are intended to be accessible using CoAP over WebSockets.") | [**RFC 8283**: CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets](/specs/IETF/RFC/8283 "The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), although inspired by HTTP, was designed to use UDP instead of TCP.

[`example`](/concepts/uri-scheme/example "There is a need for a scheme name that can be used for examples in documentation without fear of conflicts with current or future actual schemes. The scheme &#34;example&#34; is hereby registered as a 'permanent' scheme for that purpose.") | [**RFC 7595**: Guidelines and Registration Procedures for URI Schemes](/specs/IETF/RFC/7595 "This document updates the guidelines and recommendations, as well as the IANA registration processes, for the definition of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes.")
[`file`](/concepts/uri-scheme/file "A file URI identifies an object (a &#34;file&#34;) stored in a structured object naming and accessing environment on a host (a &#34;file system&#34;). The URI can be used in discussions about the file, and if other conditions are met it can be dereferenced to directly access the file.") | [**RFC 8089**: The "file" URI Scheme](/specs/IETF/RFC/8089 "This document provides a more complete specification of the &#34;file&#34; Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme and replaces the very brief definition in Section 3.10 of RFC 1738. It defines a common syntax that is intended to interoperate across the broad spectrum of existing usages. At the same time, it notes some other current practices around the use of file URIs.")

[`h323`](/concepts/uri-scheme/h323 "The H.323 URL is intended to help an entity resolve the address of another H.323 entity, where an &#34;entity&#34; may be a user, a device, or a service. The &#34;user&#34; portion of the URL specifies an alias for the entity, without carrying any information about the location of the entity. The &#34;hostport&#34;, on the other hand, is the domain name of an Endpoint, Gatekeeper, Border Element, or other functional element to which H.323 calls may be directed or for which services may be performed.") | [**RFC 3508**: H.323 Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Scheme Registration](/specs/IETF/RFC/3508 "ITU-T Recommendation H.323 version 4 introduced an H.323-specific Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

The various formats are designed to support, but not require, a strong link to the referenced object, such that the referenced object may be authenticated to the same degree as the reference to it. The reason for this work is to standardise current uses of hash outputs in URLs and to support new information-centric applications and other uses of hash outputs in protocols.")

[`payto`](/concepts/uri-scheme/payto "A 'payto' URI always identifies the target of a payment. A 'payto' URI consists of a payment target type, a target identifier, and optional parameters such as an amount or a payment reference. The interpretation of the target identifier is defined by the payment target type and typically represents either a bank account or an (unsettled) transaction. A unified URI scheme for all payment target types allows applications to offer user interactions with URIs that represent payment targets, simplifying the introduction of new payment systems and applications.") | [**RFC 8905**: The 'payto' URI scheme for payments](/specs/IETF/RFC/8905 "This document defines the 'payto' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for designating targets for payments.

A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage and messaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the Kinds of data that need to be stored for a particular application. RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique identities. NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol. RELOAD also allows access from &#34;client&#34; nodes that do not need to route traffic or store data for others.")

MRCPv2 is not a &#34;stand-alone&#34; protocol -- it relies on other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover, and exchange capabilities. It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server. Once this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above, allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.")
[`sms`](/concepts/uri-scheme/sms "This URI scheme provides information that can be used for sending SMS message(s) to specified recipient(s).

SMS messages are two-way paging messages that can be sent from and received by a mobile phone or a suitably equipped networked device.")
[`tag`](/concepts/uri-scheme/tag "A tag is a type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) designed to meet the following requirements: 1. Identifiers are likely to be unique across space and time, and come from a practically inexhaustible supply. 2. Identifiers are relatively convenient for humans to mint (create), read, type, remember etc. 3. No central registration is necessary, at least for holders of domain names or email addresses; and there is negligible cost to mint each new identifier. 4. The identifiers are independent of any particular resolution scheme.") | [**RFC 4151**: Content-ID and Message-ID Uniform Resource Locators](/specs/IETF/RFC/4151 "This document describes the &#34;tag&#34; Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme. Tag URIs (also known as &#34;tags&#34;) are designed to be unique across space and time while being tractable to humans. They are distinct from most other URIs in that they have no authoritative resolution mechanism. A tag may be used purely as an entity identifier. Furthermore, using tags has some advantages over the common practice of using &#34;http&#34; URIs as identifiers for non-HTTP-accessible resources.")
