description: "HTTP SCRAM is an HTTP Authentication mechanism whose client response and server challenge messages are text-based messages containing one or more attribute-value pairs separated by commas. SCRAM-SHA-1 is registered for database compatibility with implementations of RFC 5802 that want to also expose HTTP access to a related service, but it is not recommended for new deployments."

**[RFC 7804: Salted Challenge Response HTTP Authentication Mechanism](/specs/IETF/RFC/7804 "This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which provides a more robust authentication mechanism than a plaintext password protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) and avoids the deployment obstacles presented by earlier TLS-protected challenge response authentication mechanisms."):** [HTTP SCRAM is an HTTP Authentication mechanism whose client response and server challenge messages are text-based messages containing one or more attribute-value pairs separated by commas.
