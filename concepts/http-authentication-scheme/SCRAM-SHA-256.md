[HTTP SCRAM is an HTTP Authentication mechanism whose client response and server challenge messages are text-based messages containing one or more attribute-value pairs separated by commas. For interoperability, all HTTP clients and servers supporting SCRAM MUST implement the SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication mechanism.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7804#section-5 "Read documentation for HTTP Authentication Scheme &#34;SCRAM-SHA-256&#34;") (**[RFC 7804: Salted Challenge Response HTTP Authentication Mechanism](/specs/IETF/RFC/7804 "This specification describes a family of HTTP authentication mechanisms called the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which provides a more robust authentication mechanism than a plaintext password protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) and avoids the deployment obstacles presented by earlier TLS-protected challenge response authentication mechanisms.")**)
