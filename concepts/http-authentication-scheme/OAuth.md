[Protocol parameters can be transmitted using the HTTP "Authorization" header field as defined by RFC 2617 with the auth-scheme name set to "OAuth" (case insensitive). Servers MAY indicate their support for the "OAuth" auth-scheme by returning the HTTP "WWW-Authenticate" response header field upon client requests for protected resources.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5849#section-3.5.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Authentication Scheme &#34;OAuth&#34;") (**[RFC 5849: The OAuth 1.0 Protocol](/specs/IETF/RFC/5849 "OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner (such as a different client or an end-user). It also provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.")**)
