The server MUST redirect HTTP requests for that resource to the actual \"context path\" using one of the available mechanisms provided by HTTP (e.g., using a 301, 303, or 307 response). Clients MUST handle HTTP redirects on the \".well-known\" URI. Servers MUST NOT locate the actual CalDAV or CardDAV service endpoint at the \".well-known\" URI.",
