[HOBA-http uses a well-known URI "hoba" as a base URI for performing many tasks: "https://www.example.com/.well-known/hoba". These URIs are based on the name of the host that the HTTP client is accessing.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7486#section-6 "Read documentation for Well-Known URI &#34;hoba&#34;") (**[RFC 7486: HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7486 "HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a digital-signature-based design for an HTTP authentication method. The design can also be used in JavaScript-based authentication embedded in HTML. HOBA is an alternative to HTTP authentication schemes that require passwords and therefore avoids all problems related to passwords, such as leakage of server-side password databases.")**)
