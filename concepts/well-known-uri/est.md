[The EST server MUST support the use of the path-prefix of "/.well-known/" and the registered name of "est". Thus, a valid EST server URI path begins with "https://www.example.com/.well-known/est". Each EST operation is indicated by a path-suffix that indicates the intended operation.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7030#section-3.2.2 "Read documentation for Well-Known URI &#34;est&#34;") (**[RFC 7030: Enrollment over Secure Transport](/specs/IETF/RFC/7030 "This document profiles certificate enrollment for clients using Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) messages over a secure transport. This profile, called Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST), describes a simple, yet functional, certificate management protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) clients that need to acquire client certificates and associated Certification Authority (CA) certificates. It also supports client-generated public/private key pairs as well as key pairs generated by the CA.")**)
