**[RFC 7711: PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7711 "Experience has shown that it is difficult to deploy proper PKIX certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in multi-tenanted environments. As a result, domains hosted in such environments often deploy applications using certificates that identify the hosting service, not the hosted domain. Such deployments force end users and peer services to accept a certificate with an improper identifier, resulting in degraded security. This document defines methods that make it easier to deploy certificates for proper server identity checking in non-HTTP application protocols. Although these methods were developed for use in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as a Domain Name Association (DNA) prooftype, they might also be usable in other non-HTTP application protocols."):** [The suffix "posh" is expected to be followed by an additional path component consisting of a service name (say, "spice") and a file extension of ".json", resulting in a full path of, for instance, "/.well-known/posh/spice.json".
