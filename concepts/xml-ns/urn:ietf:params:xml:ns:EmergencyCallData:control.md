[This document defines a block of metadata/control data as an XML structure containing elements used for eCall and other related emergency call systems and extension points. The control block is an XML data structure allowing for acknowledgments, requests, and capabilities information. It is carried in a body part with a specific MIME media type.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8147#section-9.1 "Read documentation for XML Namespace &#34;urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:EmergencyCallData:control&#34;") (**[RFC 8147: Next-Generation Pan-European eCall](/specs/IETF/RFC/8147 "This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support the next generation of the Pan-European in-vehicle emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally referred to as &#34;eCall&#34;). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special form of emergency calls placed by vehicles, providing real-time communications and an integrated set of related data. This document also registers MIME media types and an Emergency Call Data Type for the eCall vehicle data and metadata/control data, and an INFO package to enable carrying this data in SIP INFO requests. Although this specification is designed to meet the requirements of next-generation Pan-European eCall (NG-eCall), it is specified generically such that the technology can be reused or extended to suit requirements across jurisdictions.")**)
