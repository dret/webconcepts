[When the key held by the presenter is an asymmetric private key, the "jwk" member is a JSON Web Key representing the corresponding asymmetric public key.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7800#section-3.2 "Read documentation for JWT Confirmation Method &#34;jwk&#34;") (**[RFC 7800: Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7800 "This specification describes how to declare in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular proof-of-possession key and how the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof of possession of the key by the presenter. Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.")**)
