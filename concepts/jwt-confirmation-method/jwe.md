[When the key held by the presenter is a symmetric key, the "jwe" member is an encrypted JSON Web Key encrypted to a key known to the recipient using the JWE Compact Serialization containing the symmetric key.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7800#section-3.3 "Read documentation for JWT Confirmation Method &#34;jwe&#34;") (**[RFC 7800: Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](/specs/IETF/RFC/7800 "This specification describes how to declare in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular proof-of-possession key and how the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof of possession of the key by the presenter. Being able to prove possession of a key is also sometimes described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.")**)
