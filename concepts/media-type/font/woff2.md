[WOFF 2.0 is used by web browsers, often in conjunction with HTML and CSS. WOFF 2.0 is an improvement on WOFF 1.0.  The two formats have different Internet Media Types and different @font-face formats, and they may be used in parallel.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8081#section-4.4.6 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;font/woff2&#34;") (**[RFC 8081: The "font" Top-Level Media Type](/specs/IETF/RFC/8081 "This memo serves to register and document the &#34;font&#34; top-level media type, under which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered. This document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes, which are representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently registered under the &#34;application&#34; tree by their separate registrations.")**)

[The primary purpose of the WOFF2 format is to efficiently package fonts linked to Web documents by means of CSS @font-face rules. WOFF 2.0 is an improvement on WOFF 1.0. The two formats have different Internet Media Types and may be used in parallel.](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WOFF2-20180301/#FileStructure "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;font/woff2&#34;") (**[W3C TR http://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2: WOFF File Format 2.0](/specs/W3C/TR/WOFF2 "Based on experience with WOFF 1.0, which is widely deployed, this specification was developed to provide improved compression and thus lower use of network bandwidth, while still allowing fast decompression even on mobile devices. This is achieved by combining a content-aware preprocessing step and improved entropy coding, compared to the Flate compression used in WOFF 1.0.")**)
