[Note that "font/sfnt" is an abstract type from which the (widely used in practice) "font/ttf" and "font/otf" types are conceptually derived. Use of "font/sfnt" is likely to be rare in practice.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8081#section-4.4.1 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;font/sfnt&#34;") (**[RFC 8081: The "font" Top-Level Media Type](/specs/IETF/RFC/8081 "This memo serves to register and document the &#34;font&#34; top-level media type, under which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered. This document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes, which are representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently registered under the &#34;application&#34; tree by their separate registrations.")**)
