description: "This specification registers the \"application/secevent+jwt\" media type, which can be used to indicate that the content is a SET. SETs MAY include this media type in the \"typ\" header parameter of the JWT representing the SET to explicitly declare that the JWT is a SET.

SETs MAY include this media type in the "typ" header parameter of the JWT representing the SET to explicitly declare that the JWT is a SET. This MUST be included if the SET could be used in an application context in which it could be confused with other kinds of JWTs.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8417#section-2.3 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/secevent+jwt&#34;") (**[RFC 8417: Security Event Token (SET)](/specs/IETF/RFC/8417 "This specification defines the Security Event Token (SET) data structure. A SET describes statements of fact from the perspective of an issuer about a subject. These statements of fact represent an event that occurred directly to or about a security subject, for example, a statement about the issuance or revocation of a token on behalf of a subject. This specification is intended to enable representing security- and identity-related events. A SET is a JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or encrypted. SETs can be distributed via protocols such as HTTP.")**)
