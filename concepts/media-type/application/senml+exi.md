[SenML is defined by a data model for measurements and simple meta-data about measurements and devices. The data is structured as a single array that contains a series of SenML Records which can each contain attributes such as an unique identifier for the sensor, the time the measurement was made, the unit the measurement is in, and the current value of the sensor.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-senml#section-8 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/senml+exi&#34;") (**[Internet Draft ietf-core-senml: Media Types for Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML)](/specs/IETF/I-D/ietf-core-senml "This specification defines media types for representing simple sensor measurements and device parameters in the Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML). Representations are defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), and Efficient XML Interchange (EXI), which share the common SenML data model. A simple sensor, such as a temperature sensor, could use this media type in protocols such as HTTP or CoAP to transport the measurements of the sensor or to be configured.")**)
