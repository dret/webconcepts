[YAML is a data serialization format that is capable of conveying one or multiple documents in a single presentation stream (e.g., a file or a network resource). The media type for YAML is application/yaml](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9512#section-2.1 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/yaml&#34;") (**[RFC 9512: YAML Media Type](/specs/IETF/RFC/9512 "This document registers the application/yaml media type and the +yaml structured syntax suffix with IANA. Both identify document components that are serialized according to the YAML specification.")**)
