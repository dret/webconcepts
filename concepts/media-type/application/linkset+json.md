[For applications that prefer a JSON serialization of link set resources, the following definition provides a JSON serialization which is intended to faithfully reproduce the abstract model of RFC 5988bis.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-linkset#section-4.2 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/linkset+json&#34;") (**[Internet Draft ietf-httpapi-linkset: Linkset: Media Types and a Link Relation Type for Link Sets](/specs/IETF/I-D/ietf-httpapi-linkset "This specification defines two document formats and respective media types for representing sets of links as stand-alone resources. One format is JSON-based, the other aligned with the format for representing links in the HTTP &#34;Link&#34; header field. This specification also introduces a link relation type to support discovery of sets of links.")**)
