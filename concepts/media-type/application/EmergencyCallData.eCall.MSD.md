[Pan-European eCall provides a standardized and mandated set of vehicle-related data (including VIN, vehicle type, propulsion type, current and optionally previous location coordinates, and the number of occupants) known as the Minimum Set of Data (MSD). The application/EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD media type enables the MSD to be carried in SIP.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8147#section-5 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/EmergencyCallData.eCall.MSD&#34;") (**[RFC 8147: Next-Generation Pan-European eCall](/specs/IETF/RFC/8147 "This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support the next generation of the Pan-European in-vehicle emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally referred to as &#34;eCall&#34;). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special form of emergency calls placed by vehicles, providing real-time communications and an integrated set of related data. This document also registers MIME media types and an Emergency Call Data Type for the eCall vehicle data and metadata/control data, and an INFO package to enable carrying this data in SIP INFO requests. Although this specification is designed to meet the requirements of next-generation Pan-European eCall (NG-eCall), it is specified generically such that the technology can be reused or extended to suit requirements across jurisdictions.")**)
