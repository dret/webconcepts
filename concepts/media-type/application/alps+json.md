[When representing ALPS documents in JSON format, the 'descriptor' and 'ext' properties are always expressed as arrays of anonymous objects - even when there is only one member in the array.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps#section-4.2 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/alps+json&#34;") (**[Internet Draft amundsen-richardson-foster-alps: Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS)](/specs/IETF/I-D/amundsen-richardson-foster-alps "This document describes ALPS, a data format for defining simple descriptions of application-level semantics, similar in complexity to HTML microformats. An ALPS document can be used as a profile to explain the application semantics of a document with an application-agnostic media type (such as HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON, Siren, etc.). This increases the reusability of profile documents across media types.")**)
