**[RFC 7303: XML Media Types](/specs/IETF/RFC/7303 "This specification standardizes three media types - application/xml, application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd - for use in exchanging network entities that are related to the Extensible Markup Language (XML) while defining text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity as aliases for the respective application/ types. This specification also standardizes the '+xml' suffix for naming media types outside of these five types when those media types represent XML MIME entities."):** [The media types application/xml or text/xml, or a more specific media type, SHOULD be used for XML document entities.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7303#section-4.1 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/xml&#34;")
