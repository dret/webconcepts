[Since there are different flavors of MARC which would be processed by different applications, this content-type/subtype refers to the harmonized USMARC/CANMARC specification. Additional content-types/subtypes may be defined in the future (e.g. application/unimarc).](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2220#section-2 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/marc&#34;") (**[RFC 2220: The Application/MARC Content-type](/specs/IETF/RFC/2220 "This memorandum provides a mechanism for representing objects which are files of Machine-Readable Cataloging records (MARC). The MARC formats are standards for the representation and communication of bibliographic and related information. A MARC record contains metadata for an information resource following MARC format specifications.")**)
