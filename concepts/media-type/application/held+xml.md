Note that the XML Schema Definition is not intended to be used with on-the-fly validation of the presence XML document.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5985#section-7 "Read documentation for Media Type &#34;application/held+xml&#34;") (**[RFC 5985: HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)](/specs/IETF/RFC/5985 "This document defines a Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol (L7 LCP) and describes the use of HTTP and HTTP/TLS as transports for the L7 LCP. The L7 LCP is used for retrieving location information from a server within an access network. It includes options for retrieving location information in two forms: by value and by reference. The protocol is an extensible application-layer protocol that is independent of the session layer.")**)
