description: "If an XML external parsed entity - that is, the unprocessed, source XML entity - is readable by casual users, text/xml-external-parsed-entity is preferable to application/xml-external-parsed-entity. MIME user agents (and web user agents) that do not have explicit support for text/xml-external-parsed-entity will treat it as text/plain, for example, by displaying the XML MIME entity as plain text."

**[RFC 3023: XML Media Types](/specs/IETF/RFC/3023 "This document standardizes five new media types - text/xml, application/xml, text/xml-external-parsed-entity, application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd - for use in exchanging network entities that are related to the Extensible Markup Language (XML). This document also standardizes a convention (using the suffix '+xml') for naming media types outside of these five types when those media types represent XML MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) entities. XML MIME entities are currently exchanged via the HyperText Transfer Protocol on the World Wide Web, are an integral part of the WebDAV protocol for remote web authoring, and are expected to have utility in many domains."):** [If an XML external parsed entity - that is, the unprocessed, source XML entity - is readable by casual users, text/xml-external-parsed-entity is preferable to application/xml-external-parsed-entity.
