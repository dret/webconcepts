description: "This memo updates the text/plain media type defined in RFC 2046  by defining URI fragment identifiers for text/plain MIME entities. This makes it possible to refer to parts of a text/plain MIME entity. Such parts can be identified by either character position or range, or by line position or range. Integrity checking information can be added to a fragment identifier to make it more robust, enabling applications to detect changes of the entity."
