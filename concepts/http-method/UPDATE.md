**[RFC 3253: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](/specs/IETF/RFC/3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. WebDAV versioning will minimize the complexity of clients that are capable of interoperating with a variety of versioning repository managers, to facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of utilizing the WebDAV Versioning services. WebDAV versioning includes automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history management, workspace management, baseline management, activity management, and URL namespace versioning."):** [The UPDATE method modifies the content and dead properties of a checked-in version-controlled resource (the "update target") to be those of a specified version (the "update source") from the version history of that version-controlled resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-7.1 "Read documentation for HTTP Request Method &#34;UPDATE&#34;")
