description: "The TRACE method requests a remote, application-level loop-back of the request message. The final recipient of the request SHOULD reflect the message received, excluding some fields described below, back to the client as the message body of a 200 (OK) response with a Content-Type of \"message/http\". The final recipient is either the origin server or the first server to receive a Max-Forwards value of zero (0) in the request."
