**[RFC 3253: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](/specs/IETF/RFC/3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. WebDAV versioning will minimize the complexity of clients that are capable of interoperating with a variety of versioning repository managers, to facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of utilizing the WebDAV Versioning services. WebDAV versioning includes automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history management, workspace management, baseline management, activity management, and URL namespace versioning."):** [A MKACTIVITY request creates a new activity resource. A server MAY restrict activity creation to particular collections, but a client can determine the location of these collections from a DAV:activity-collection-set OPTIONS request.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253#section-13.5 "Read documentation for HTTP Request Method &#34;MKACTIVITY&#34;")
