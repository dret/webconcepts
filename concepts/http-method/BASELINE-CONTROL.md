[A collection can be placed under baseline control with a BASELINE-CONTROL request. When a collection is placed under baseline control, the DAV:version-controlled-configuration property of the collection is set to identify a new version-controlled configuration. This version-controlled configuration can be checked out and then checked in to create a new baseline for that collection.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3253#section-12.6 "Read documentation for HTTP Request Method &#34;BASELINE-CONTROL&#34;") (**[RFC 3253: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)](/specs/IETF/RFC/3253 "This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types that define the WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. WebDAV versioning will minimize the complexity of clients that are capable of interoperating with a variety of versioning repository managers, to facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of utilizing the WebDAV Versioning services. WebDAV versioning includes automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients, version history management, workspace management, baseline management, activity management, and URL namespace versioning.")**)
