A successful PUT of a given representation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same target resource will result in an equivalent representation being sent in a 200 (OK) response. However, there is no guarantee that such a state change will be observable, since the target resource might be acted upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be subject to dynamic processing by the origin server, before any subsequent GET is received. A successful response only implies that the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its processing by the origin server.","documentation":"http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7231#section-4.3.4","specification":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/specs\/IETF\/RFC\/7231","spec-name":"\"RFC 7231\",\n"}]}
