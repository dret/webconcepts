The server SHOULD send the same header fields in response to a HEAD request as it would have sent if the request had been a GET, except that the payload header fields MAY be omitted. This method can be used for obtaining metadata about the selected representation without transferring the representation data and is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.","documentation":"http:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc7231#section-4.3.2","specification":"http:\/\/webconcepts.info\/specs\/IETF\/RFC\/7231"}]}
