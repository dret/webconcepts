title:  "HTTP Request Method: UPDATEREDIRECTREF"
---

**[RFC 4437: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV): Redirect Reference Resources](/specs/IETF/RFC/4437 "This specification defines an extension to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) to allow clients to author HTTP redirect reference resources whose default response is an HTTP/1.1 3xx (Redirection) status code. A redirect reference makes it possible to access the target resourced indirectly through any URI mapped to the redirect reference resource. This specification does not address remapping of trees of resources or regular expression based redirections. There are no integrity guarantees associated with redirect reference resources. Other mechanisms can also be used to achieve the same functionality as this specification. This specification allows operators to experiment with this mechanism and develop experience on what is the best approach to the problem."):** [The UPDATEREDIRECTREF method requests the update of a redirect reference resource.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4437#section-7)
