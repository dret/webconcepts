To dramatically simplify this spec in several places where we had to choose between supporting A or B, we took it upon ourselves to say &#34;only A&#34;, rather than making it an implementation decision. We offer this spec in hopes that it fills a need or at least advances the state of the discussion in the pubsub space. Polling is extremely wasteful and high latency.
