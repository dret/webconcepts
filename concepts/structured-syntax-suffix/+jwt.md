[The "+jwt" structured syntax suffix can be used to indicate that the media type is encoded as a JWT.](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8417#section-7.2 "Read documentation for Structured Syntax Suffix &#34;+jwt&#34;") (**[RFC 8417: Security Event Token (SET)](/specs/IETF/RFC/8417 "This specification defines the Security Event Token (SET) data structure. A SET describes statements of fact from the perspective of an issuer about a subject. These statements of fact represent an event that occurred directly to or about a security subject, for example, a statement about the issuance or revocation of a token on behalf of a subject. This specification is intended to enable representing security- and identity-related events. A SET is a JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or encrypted. SETs can be distributed via protocols such as HTTP.")**)
