**[RFC 6839: Additional Media Type Structured Syntax Suffixes](/specs/IETF/RFC/6839 "A content media type name sometimes includes partitioned meta-information distinguished by a structured syntax to permit noting an attribute of the media as a suffix to the name. This document defines several structured syntax suffixes for use with media type registrations. In particular, it defines and registers the &#34;+json&#34;, &#34;+ber&#34;, &#34;+der&#34;, &#34;+fastinfoset&#34;, &#34;+wbxml&#34; and &#34;+zip&#34; structured syntax suffixes, and provides a media type structured syntax suffix registration form for the &#34;+xml&#34; structured syntax suffix."):** [The suffix "+zip" MAY be used with any media type whose representation follows that established for "application/zip".](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6839#section-3.6 "Read documentation for Structured Syntax Suffix &#34;+zip&#34;")
