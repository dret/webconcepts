<!-- This description ignores all the HTTP header fields that have been specified in the newer RFC 4918. Only the Status-URI header field is listed here, because it is the only header field that has been specified in RFC 2518, but has not been included in RFC 4918. -->

        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2518#section-10.1">The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request, but has not yet completed it. This status code SHOULD only be sent when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST send a final response after the request has been completed.</documentation>
