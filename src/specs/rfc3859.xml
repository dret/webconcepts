    <title>Common Profile for Presence (CPP)</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3859">At the time this document was written, numerous presence protocols were in use (largely as components of commercial instant messaging services), and little interoperability between services based on these protocols has been achieved.  This specification defines common semantics and data formats for presence to facilitate the creation of gateways between presence services.</documentation>

        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3859#appendix-A.4">Use of the pres: URI follows closely usage of the mailto: URI. That is, invocation of an PRES URI will cause the user's instant messaging application to start, with destination address and message headers  fill-in according to the information supplied in the URI.</documentation>
