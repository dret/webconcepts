    <title>Uniform Resource Names (URNs)</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141">A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is assigned under the "urn" URI scheme and a particular URN namespace, with the intent that the URN will be a persistent, location-independent resource identifier. With regard to URN syntax, this document defines the canonical syntax for URNs (in a way that is consistent with URI syntax), specifies methods for determining URN-equivalence, and discusses URI conformance. With regard to URN namespaces, this document specifies a method for defining a URN namespace and associating it with a namespace identifier, and it describes procedures for registering namespace identifiers with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This document obsoletes both RFCs 2141 and 3406.</documentation>

A URN namespace is a collection of such URNs, each of which is unique, assigned in a consistent and managed way, and assigned according to a common definition.</documentation>
