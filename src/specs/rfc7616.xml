    <title>HTTP Digest Access Authentication</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7616">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) provides a simple challenge-response authentication mechanism that may be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information. This document defines the HTTP Digest Authentication scheme that can be used with the HTTP authentication mechanism.</documentation>
    <http-header def="WWW-Authenticate">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7616#section-3.3">If a server receives a request for an access-protected object, and an acceptable Authorization header is not sent, the server responds with a "401 Unauthorized" status code, and a WWW-Authenticate header as per the framework defined above.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-header def="Authorization">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7616#section-3.4">The client is expected to retry the request, passing an Authorization header field line with Digest scheme, which is defined according to the framework above. The values of the opaque and algorithm fields must be those supplied in the WWW-Authenticate response header field for the entity being requested.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-authentication-scheme def="Digest">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7616#section-3">The Digest scheme is based on a simple challenge-response paradigm. The Digest scheme challenges using a nonce value and might indicate that username hashing is supported. A valid response contains an unkeyed digest of the username, the password, the given nonce value, the HTTP method, and the requested URI.</documentation>
