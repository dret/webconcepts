    <title>The "font" Top-Level Media Type</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8081">This memo serves to register and document the "font" top-level media type, under which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered. This document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes, which are representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently registered under the "application" tree by their separate registrations.</documentation>

        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8081#section-4.4.1">Note that "font/sfnt" is an abstract type from which the (widely used in practice) "font/ttf" and "font/otf" types are conceptually derived. Use of "font/sfnt" is likely to be rare in practice.</documentation>
