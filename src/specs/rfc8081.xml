    <title>The "font" Top-Level Media Type</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8081">This memo serves to register and document the "font" top-level media type, under which subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered. This document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes, which are representative of some existing subtypes already in use, and currently registered under the "application" tree by their separate registrations.</documentation>
