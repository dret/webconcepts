    <title>H.323 Uniform Resource Locator (URL) Scheme Registration</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3508">ITU-T Recommendation H.323 version 4 introduced an H.323-specific Uniform Resource Locator (URL). This document reproduces the H323-URL definition found in H.323, and is published as an RFC for ease of access and registration with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).</documentation>

        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3508##section-2">The H.323 URL is intended to help an entity resolve the address of another H.323 entity, where an "entity" may be a user, a device, or a service. The "user" portion of the URL specifies an alias for the entity, without carrying any information about the location of the entity. The "hostport", on the other hand, is the domain name of an Endpoint, Gatekeeper, Border Element, or other functional element to which H.323 calls may be directed or for which services may be performed.</documentation>
