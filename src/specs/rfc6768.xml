    <title>Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2)</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5829">The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the network. MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol -- it relies on other protocols, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers and manage sessions between them, and the Session Description Protocol (SDP) to describe, discover, and exchange capabilities. It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server. Once this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange operates over the control session established above, allowing the client to control the media processing resources on the speech resource server.</documentation>

The purpose of this scheme is to permit access to the specific resource for the lifetime of the session with the entity storing the resource.</documentation>
