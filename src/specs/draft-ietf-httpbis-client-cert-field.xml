    <title>Client-Cert HTTP Header Field</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-cert-field">This document defines HTTP extension header fields that allow a TLS terminating reverse proxy to convey the client certificate information of a mutually-authenticated TLS connection to the origin server in a common and predictable manner.</documentation>
    <http-header def="Client-Cert">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-cert-field#section-2.2">In the context of a TLS terminating reverse proxy deployment, the proxy makes the TLS client certificate available to the backend application with the Client-Cert HTTP header field. This field contains the end-entity certificate used by the client in the TLS handshake.</documentation>

        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-cert-field#section-2.3">In the context of a TLS terminating reverse proxy deployment, the proxy MAY make the certificate chain used for validation of the end-entity certificate available to the backend application with the Client-Cert-Chain HTTP header field. This field contains certificates used by the proxy to validate the certificate used by the client in the TLS handshake. These certificates might or might not have been provided by the client during the TLS handshake.</documentation>
