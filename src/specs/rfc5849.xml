    <title>The OAuth 1.0 Protocol</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5849">OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner (such as a different client or an end-user). It also provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.</documentation>
