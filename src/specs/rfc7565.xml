    <title>The 'acct' URI Scheme</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7565">This document defines the 'acct' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme as a way to identify a user's account at a service provider, irrespective of the particular protocols that can be used to interact with the account.</documentation>
    <uri-scheme def="acct">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7565#section-4">Although 'acct' URIs take the form "user@host", the scheme is designed for the purpose of identification instead of interaction. The "Internet resource" identified by an 'acct' URI is a user's account hosted at a service provider, where the service provider is typically associated with a DNS domain name.</documentation>
