    <title>Linked Cache Invalidation</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-linked-cache-inv">This memo defines two new link types that indicate relationships between resources in terms of cache invalidation, along with a HTTP cache-control extension that takes advantage of those relationships to use them to extend response freshness. Collectively, this is referred to as Linked Cache Invalidation (LCI).</documentation>
    <link-relation def="invalidates">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-linked-cache-inv#section-2">The 'invalidates' link relation type allows a response that signifies a state change on the server to indicate one or more associated URIs whose states have also changed.</documentation>
    </link-relation>
    <link-relation def="inv-by">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-linked-cache-inv#section-3">The 'inv-by' link relation type allows a response to nominate one or more other resources that affect the state of the resource it's associated with. That is, when one of the nominated resources changes, it also changes the state of this response's resource.</documentation>
    </link-relation>
    <http-cache-directive def="inv-maxage">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-nottingham-linked-cache-inv#section-4">When present, the 'inv-maxage' cache-control extension indicates the number of seconds that caches who implement Linked Cache invalidation can consider responses fresh for, provided they are not invalidated.</documentation>
