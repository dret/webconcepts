    <title>Targeted HTTP Cache Control</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9213">This specification defines a convention for HTTP response header fields that allow cache directives to be targeted at specific caches or classes of caches. It also defines one such header field, the CDN-Cache-Control response header field, which is targeted at content delivery network (CDN) caches.</documentation>
    <http-header def="CDN-Cache-Control">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9213#section-3">The CDN-Cache-Control response header field is a targeted field that allows origin servers to control the behavior of CDN caches interposed between them and clients separately from other caches that might handle the response. It applies to caches that are part of a distributed network that operate on behalf of an origin server (commonly called a CDN).</documentation>
