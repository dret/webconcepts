    <title>URI Fragment Identifiers for the text/plain Media Type</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5147">This memo defines URI fragment identifiers for text/plain MIME entities. These fragment identifiers make it possible to refer to parts of a text/plain MIME entity, either identified by character position or range, or by line position or range. Fragment identifiers may also contain information for integrity checks to make them more robust.</documentation>

        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5147#section-1">This memo updates the text/plain media type defined in RFC 2046  by defining URI fragment identifiers for text/plain MIME entities. This makes it possible to refer to parts of a text/plain MIME entity. Such parts can be identified by either character position or range, or by line position or range. Integrity checking information can be added to a fragment identifier to make it more robust, enabling applications to detect changes of the entity.</documentation>
