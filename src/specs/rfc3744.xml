    <title>Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Access Control Protocol</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3744">This document specifies a set of methods, headers, message bodies, properties, and reports that define Access Control extensions to the WebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol. This protocol permits a client to read and modify access control lists that instruct a server whether to allow or deny operations upon a resource (such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method invocations) by a given principal. A lightweight representation of principals as Web resources supports integration of a wide range of user management repositories. Search operations allow discovery and manipulation of principals using human names.</documentation>
    <http-method def="ACL">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3744#section-8.1">The ACL method modifies the access control list (which can be read via the DAV:acl property) of a resource. Specifically, the ACL method only permits modification to ACEs that are not inherited, and are not protected.</documentation>
