    <title>HTTP SEARCH Method</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body">This specification updates the definition and semantics of the HTTP SEARCH request method originally defined by RFC 5323.</documentation>
    <http-method def="SEARCH">
        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body#section-2">The SEARCH method is used to initiate a server-side search. Unlike the HTTP GET method, which requests that a server return a representation of the resource identified by the target URI, the SEARCH method is used to ask the server to perform a query operation (described by the request payload) over some set of data scoped to the effective request URI. The payload returned in response to a SEARCH cannot be assumed to be a representation of the resource identified by the effective request URI.</documentation>
    </http-method>

        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body#section-3">The "Accept-Search" response header field MAY be used by a server to directly signal support for the SEARCH method while identifying the specific query format media types that may be used.</documentation>
