    <title>The Application/MARC Content-type</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2220">This memorandum provides a mechanism for representing objects which are files of Machine-Readable Cataloging records (MARC). The MARC formats are standards for the representation and communication of bibliographic and related information. A MARC record contains metadata for an information resource following MARC format specifications.</documentation>
    <media-type def="application/marc">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2220#section-2">Since there are different flavors of MARC which would be processed by different applications, this content-type/subtype refers to the harmonized USMARC/CANMARC specification. Additional content-types/subtypes may be defined in the future (e.g. application/unimarc).</documentation>
