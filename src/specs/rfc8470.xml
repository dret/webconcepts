    <title>Using Early Data in HTTP</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8470">Using TLS early data creates an exposure to the possibility of a replay attack. This document defines mechanisms that allow clients to communicate with servers about HTTP requests that are sent in early data. Techniques are described that use these mechanisms to mitigate the risk of replay.</documentation>
    <http-header def="Early-Data">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8470#section-5.1">The Early-Data request header field indicates that the request has been conveyed in early data and that a client understands the 425 (Too Early) status code.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-status-code def="425" desc="Too Early">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8470#section-5.2">A 425 (Too Early) status code indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed. User agents that send a request in early data are expected to retry the request when receiving a 425 (Too Early) response status code. A user agent SHOULD retry automatically, but any retries MUST NOT be sent in early data.</documentation>
