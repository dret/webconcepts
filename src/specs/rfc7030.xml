    <title>Enrollment over Secure Transport</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7030">This document profiles certificate enrollment for clients using Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) messages over a secure transport. This profile, called Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST), describes a simple, yet functional, certificate management protocol targeting Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) clients that need to acquire client certificates and associated Certification Authority (CA) certificates. It also supports client-generated public/private key pairs as well as key pairs generated by the CA.</documentation>
    <well-known-uri def="est">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7030#section-3.2.2">The EST server MUST support the use of the path-prefix of "/.well-known/" and the registered name of "est". Thus, a valid EST server URI path begins with "https://www.example.com/.well-known/est". Each EST operation is indicated by a path-suffix that indicates the intended operation.</documentation>
