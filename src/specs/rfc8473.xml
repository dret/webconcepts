    <title>Token Binding over HTTP</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8473">This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP servers to cryptographically bind security tokens (such as cookies and OAuth tokens) to TLS connections. We describe both first-party and federated scenarios. In a first-party scenario, an HTTP server is able to cryptographically bind the security tokens that it issues to a client -- and that the client subsequently returns to the server -- to the TLS connection between the client and the server. Such bound security tokens are protected from misuse, since the server can generally detect if they are replayed inappropriately, e.g., over other TLS connections. Federated Token Bindings, on the other hand, allow servers to cryptographically bind security tokens to a TLS connection that the client has with a different server than the one issuing the token.</documentation>
    <http-header def="Sec-Token-Binding">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8473#section-2">Once a client and server have negotiated the Token Binding protocol with HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, clients MUST include a Sec-Token-Binding header field in their HTTP requests and MUST include only one such header field per HTTP request. Also, the Sec-Token-Binding header field MUST NOT be included in HTTP responses.</documentation>

    <http-header def="Include-Referred-Token-Binding-ID">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8473#section-5.3">When a Token Consumer redirects the client to a Token Provider as a means to deliver the token request, it SHOULD include an Include-Referred-Token-Binding-ID HTTP response header field in its HTTP response.</documentation>
