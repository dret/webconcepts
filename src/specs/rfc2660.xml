    <title>The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (S-HTTP)</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2660">This memo describes a syntax for securing messages sent using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basis for the World Wide Web. Secure HTTP (S-HTTP) provides independently applicable security services for transaction confidentiality, authenticity/integrity and non-repudiability of origin. The protocol emphasizes maximum flexibility in choice of key management mechanisms, security policies and cryptographic algorithms by supporting option negotiation between parties for each transaction.</documentation>
    <http-header def="Security-Scheme">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2660#section-4.1">All S-HTTP compliant agents must generate the Security-Scheme header in the headers of all HTTP messages they generate. This header permits other agents to detect that they are communicating with an S-HTTP compliant agent and generate the appropriate cryptographic options headers.</documentation>
