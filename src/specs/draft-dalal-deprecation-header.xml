    <title>The Deprecation HTTP Header Field</title>
    <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dalal-deprecation-header">The HTTP Deprecation response header field can be used to signal to consumers of a URI-identified resource that the use of the resource has been deprecated. Additionally, the deprecation link relation can be used to link to a resource that provides additional context for the deprecation, and possibly ways in which clients can find a replacement for the deprecated resource.</documentation>

        <documentation source="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-dalal-deprecation-header#section-3">In addition to the Deprecation HTTP header field, the server can use links with the "deprecation" link relation type to communicate to the client where to find more information about deprecation of the context. This information can be in the form of documentation of the resource including details about the deprecation related aspects of the context or the deprecation policy of the context provider or both for example.</documentation>
