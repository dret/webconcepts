    <title>Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8613">This document defines Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), a method for application-layer protection of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), using CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). OSCORE provides end-to-end protection between endpoints communicating using CoAP or CoAP-mappable HTTP. OSCORE is designed for constrained nodes and networks supporting a range of proxy operations, including translation between different transport protocols.</documentation>
