    <title>Duplicate Suppression in HTTP</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mogul-http-dupsup">A significant fraction of Web content is often exactly duplicated under several different URIs. This duplication can lead to suboptimal use of network bandwidth, and unnecessary latency for users. Much of this duplication can be avoided through the use of a simple mechanism, described here, which allows a cache to efficiently substitute one byte-for-byte identical value for another. By doing so, the cache avoids some or all of the network costs associated with retrieving the duplicate value.</documentation>
    <http-header def="SubOK">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mogul-http-dupsup#section-5.2.1">The SubOK request header field is used to provide directives from an end-client to a proxy cache regarding the possible substitution of an instance body from a cached response for one resource instance for the instance body of the resource instance specified by the client's request.</documentation>
    </http-header>
    <http-header def="Subst">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-mogul-http-dupsup#section-5.2.2">The Subst response-header field MUST be used by a proxy to supply the URI of the original source of an entity-body, if the source is different from the client's Request-URI, and if the client's request included the "inform" directive in a SubOK request header field.</documentation>
