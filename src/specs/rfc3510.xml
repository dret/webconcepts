    <title>Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: IPP URL Scheme</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3510">This memo defines the "ipp" URL (Uniform Resource Locator) scheme. This memo updates IPP/1.1: Encoding and Transport (RFC 2910), by expanding and clarifying Section 5, "IPP URL Scheme", of RFC 2910. An "ipp" URL is used to specify the network location of a print service that supports the IPP Protocol (RFC 2910), or of a network resource (for example, a print job) managed by such a print service.</documentation>

        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3510#section-4">The "ipp" URL scheme MUST only be used to specify absolute URLs (relative IPP URLs are not allowed) for IPP print services and their associated network resources. The "ipp" URL scheme MUST only be used to specify the use of the abstract protocol defined in IPP Model over an HTTP transport, as defined in IPP Protocol.</documentation>
