    <title>Use of the Prefer Header Field in Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8144">This document defines how the Prefer header field (RFC 7240) can be used by a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client to request that certain behaviors be employed by a server while constructing a response to a request. Furthermore, it defines the new "depth-noroot" preference.</documentation>
    <http-preference def="depth-noroot">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8144#section-4">The "depth-noroot" preference indicates that the client wishes for the server to exclude the target (root) resource from processing by the HTTP method and only apply the HTTP method to the target resource's subordinate resources.</documentation>
    </http-preference>
