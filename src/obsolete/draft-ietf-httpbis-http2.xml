    <title>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2">This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients. This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.</documentation>
    <http-header def="HTTP2-Settings">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2#section-3.2.1">A request that upgrades from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 MUST include exactly one "HTTP2-Settings" header field. The "HTTP2-Settings" header field is a connection-specific header field that includes parameters that govern the HTTP/2 connection, provided in anticipation of the server accepting the request to upgrade.</documentation>
