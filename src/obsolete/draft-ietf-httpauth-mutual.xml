    <title>Mutual Authentication Protocol for HTTP</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpauth-mutual">This document specifies a mutual authentication scheme for the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This scheme provides true mutual authentication between an HTTP client and an HTTP server using password-based authentication. Unlike the Basic and Digest authentication schemes, the Mutual authentication scheme specified in this document assures the user that the server truly knows the user's encrypted password.</documentation>
