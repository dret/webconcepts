    <title>HTTP framework for time-based access to resource states - Memento</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-vandesompel-memento">The HTTP-based Memento framework bridges the present and past Web. It facilitates obtaining representations of prior states of a given resource by introducing datetime negotiation and TimeMaps. Datetime negotiation is a variation on content negotiation that leverages the given resource's URI and a user agent's preferred datetime. TimeMaps are lists that enumerate URIs of resources that encapsulate prior states of the given resource. The framework also facilitates recognizing a resource that encapsulates a frozen prior state of another resource.</documentation>
    <http-header def="Accept-Datetime">
        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-vandesompel-memento#section-2.1.1">The "Accept-Datetime" request header is transmitted by a user agent to indicate it wants to access a past state of an Original Resource. To that end, the "Accept-Datetime" header is conveyed in an HTTP request issued against a TimeGate for an Original Resource, and its value indicates the datetime of the desired past state of the Original Resource.</documentation>

        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-vandesompel-memento#section-2.1.1">The "Memento-Datetime" response header is used by a server to indicate that a response reflects a prior state of an Original Resource. Its value expresses the datetime of that state.</documentation>
