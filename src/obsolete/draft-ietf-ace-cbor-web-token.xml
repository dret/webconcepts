    <title>CBOR Web Token (CWT)</title>
    <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ace-cbor-web-token">CBOR Web Token (CWT) is a compact means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a CWT are encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) is used for added application layer security protection. A claim is a piece of information asserted about a subject and is represented as a name/value pair consisting of a claim name and a claim value. CWT is derived from JSON Web Token (JWT) but uses CBOR rather than JSON.</documentation>

        <documentation source="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-ace-cbor-web-token#section-1">How to determine that a CBOR data structure is a CWT is application-dependent. In some cases, this information is known from the application context, such as from the position of the CWT in a data structure at which the value must be a CWT. One method of indicating that a CBOR object is a CWT is the use of the "application/cwt" content type by a transport protocol. </documentation>
